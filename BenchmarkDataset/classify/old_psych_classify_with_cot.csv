Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors in shaping behavior. In other words, people tend to attribute someone's behavior to their character or disposition, rather than considering the circumstances that may have influenced their actions.

In the given example, the boyfriend's behavior can be seen as an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. He is attributing Rachel Zegler's statements and behavior to her supposed personality traits, such as being ""full of herself,"" ""too smug,"" or ""thinks she's smart."" He is essentially making a character judgment about her based on limited information, without considering the context or potential situational factors that may have influenced her words and actions.

Moreover, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be driven by his own discomfort with confident, expressive, and outspoken women, rather than any objective assessment of Rachel Zegler's character. He is projecting his own biases and prejudices onto her, and using her as a proxy to express his dissatisfaction with feminism or women who don't conform to traditional gender roles.

The fact that he tells his girlfriend that she must secretly find Rachel Zegler annoying, and that she's only defending her because of her feminist ideology, further reinforces this interpretation. He is attributing his girlfriend's opinions and behaviors to her supposed underlying personality or motivations, rather than considering the possibility that she may have her own independent thoughts and feelings about the matter.

Overall, the boyfriend's behavior in this example illustrates a classic case of the Fundamental Attribution Error, where he is overestimating the role of personality and underestimating the impact of situational factors in shaping Rachel Zegler's behavior, and using this attribution to express his own biases and prejudices.

AIO for reporting a lazy delivery person?
I was absolutely furious! I just had to report this person because there was zero effort made on their part. In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot. Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors in shaping behavior. In other words, when we observe someone's behavior, we tend to attribute it to their character or disposition, rather than considering the circumstances that may have influenced their actions.

In the given example, the customer is furious with the delivery person, assuming that they made ""zero effort"" to deliver the order. The customer's anger and decision to report the delivery person are based on the assumption that the delivery person is lazy or incompetent. However, there may be situational factors that contributed to the delivery person's behavior, such as traffic, road closures, or difficulties with the delivery route.

The customer's reaction is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. By attributing the delivery person's behavior to their supposed laziness, the customer is ignoring potential situational factors that may have played a role. The customer's anger and decision to report the delivery person are based on a simplistic and potentially misleading attribution of the delivery person's behavior.

Furthermore, the customer's use of language, such as ""zero effort made on their part,"" suggests a strong dispositionist attribution, implying that the delivery person's behavior is a reflection of their character or personality. The customer's failure to consider alternative explanations, such as situational factors or communication breakdowns, reinforces the idea that they are committing the Fundamental Attribution Error.

It is also worth noting that the customer's emotional state, particularly their anger, may have contributed to their biased attribution. When we are emotionally aroused, we are more likely to rely on mental shortcuts and biases, such as the Fundamental Attribution Error, rather than taking a more nuanced and situational perspective.

In conclusion, the customer's reaction to the delivery person's behavior is a clear instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. By attributing the delivery person's behavior to their supposed laziness, the customer is ignoring potential situational factors and relying on a simplistic and potentially misleading dispositionist attribution.

Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors in shaping behavior.

In the example provided, the author's friends and family are making judgments about their character based on their behavior (telling a lie about buying a new couch and subsequent lies to cover it up). The author's social circle is attributing their behavior to their personality, calling them ""the couch liar"" and perceiving them as ""fragile, or fake, or both."" This attribution suggests that the author's friends and family believe that their behavior is a reflection of their underlying character, rather than considering the possibility that the author was influenced by situational factors, such as feeling pressure to keep up with their peers or seeking validation.

The author themselves also seems to be struggling with the idea that their behavior is a reflection of their character, stating ""And the thing is… they're not wrong."" This self-attribution suggests that the author is also falling victim to the FAE, believing that their behavior is a reflection of their inherent personality rather than a result of the situation.

However, upon closer examination, it can be argued that situational factors played a significant role in the author's behavior. The author was in a social setting where everyone was sharing their accomplishments and upgrades, and they felt pressure to fit in. They also mention that they ""just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together."" This suggests that the author's behavior was influenced by a desire to belong and feel validated, rather than a inherent tendency to be dishonest.

Therefore, the example provided can be seen as an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as the author's friends and family (and the author themselves) are attributing their behavior to their character, rather than considering the situational factors that may have contributed to their actions.

Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Is this normal? What the heck do I do? I just feel sick about it and I can't make myself think straight.",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors in shaping behavior.

In the given example, the father's behavior can be seen as a manifestation of the Fundamental Attribution Error. When the son suggests renting a lakehouse or an Airbnb, the father responds with a personal attack, attributing the son's suggestion to his perceived laziness and weight. The father fails to consider the situational factors that may have led to the son's suggestion, such as the desire for a more relaxed and flexible vacation experience.

Instead, the father jumps to the conclusion that the son's suggestion is a result of his inherent laziness and lack of motivation. This attribution is not only hurtful but also inaccurate, as the son's work ethic and accomplishments (e.g., working hard, improving himself, and healing from his TBI) suggest that he is not lazy.

Furthermore, the father's behavior is also influenced by his own biases and emotions, which are not acknowledged or taken into account. His defensiveness and anger towards the son's suggestion may be driven by his own stress, frustration, or feelings of inadequacy, rather than any objective assessment of the son's character.

The son, on the other hand, is aware of the situational factors that may have contributed to the father's behavior, such as his own stress and frustration. The son also recognizes that the father's attribution is unfair and inaccurate, and he attempts to correct the father's perception by providing evidence of his hard work and accomplishments.

In conclusion, the father's behavior in this example illustrates the Fundamental Attribution Error, as he overestimates the role of the son's personality and underestimates the impact of situational factors in shaping his behavior. The son's awareness of the situational factors and his attempts to correct the father's perception demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and a willingness to consider alternative explanations.

Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

In other words, when we observe someone's behavior, we tend to attribute it to their character or disposition, rather than considering the circumstances that may have influenced their actions.

In the given example, the narrator encounters a woman who is being extremely rude and entitled, arguing over a shopping cart and refusing to accept the employee's explanation. The narrator is shocked and amused by the woman's behavior, and attributes it to her personality, calling her ""Rude Lady"" and implying that she is a selfish and entitled person.

However, it's possible that the woman's behavior was influenced by situational factors, such as stress, frustration, or a sense of entitlement that is not necessarily a fixed aspect of her personality. Perhaps she was having a bad day, or was under a lot of pressure, which led her to behave in a way that was out of character for her.

The narrator's attribution of the woman's behavior to her personality, rather than considering potential situational factors, is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. The narrator is quick to judge the woman's character based on a single interaction, without considering the possibility that her behavior may have been influenced by factors outside of her control.

Furthermore, the narrator's tone and language, such as calling the woman ""Rude Lady"" and ""Karen-level tone"", suggests that they are making a moral judgment about the woman's character, rather than trying to understand the circumstances that may have led to her behavior.

Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

In other words, people tend to attribute someone's behavior or performance to their internal dispositions, character, or abilities, rather than to external circumstances or environmental factors.

In the example provided, the author and their friends are concerned about the friend's decision to drop out of school and pursue singing full-time, despite his lack of talent and poor reception of his music. The author attributes the friend's decision to his passion for singing and his conviction that he can succeed with more time and effort. However, the author also mentions that the friend's family is ""artistically inclined"" and has always been supportive of his singing, which could be seen as an external factor influencing his decision.

The question is whether the author and their friends are committing the Fundamental Attribution Error by attributing the friend's decision to his internal dispositions (e.g., his passion for singing, his conviction that he can succeed) rather than to external factors (e.g., his family's support, the lack of constructive feedback from others).

Upon closer examination, it appears that the author and their friends are indeed committing the Fundamental Attribution Error. They are attributing the friend's decision to his internal dispositions, such as his passion for singing and his conviction that he can succeed, rather than to external factors, such as the lack of constructive feedback from others, the ease of self-publishing music online, and the potential for social media to create a false sense of validation.

Additionally, the author and their friends are also underestimating the impact of situational factors, such as the friend's lack of self-awareness about his singing abilities, the potential for his family's support to create a biased perception of his talents, and the role of social media in creating a false sense of success.

Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

In other words, people tend to attribute someone's behavior to their character or disposition, rather than considering the circumstances that may have influenced their actions.

In this scenario, the parents' reaction to the daughter's negative response to their surprise celebration is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. When the daughter expresses her feelings of humiliation and disappointment, the parents attribute her behavior to her being an ""ungrateful, spoiled brat."" They fail to consider the situational factors that may have contributed to her reaction, such as the awkwardness of being singled out in front of a large crowd, the feeling of upstaging her cousin's wedding, and the fact that she had already agreed to celebrate her birthday at a later date.

The parents' attribution of their daughter's behavior to her character, rather than considering the situational factors, is a clear instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. They are overlooking the fact that their daughter's reaction is a reasonable response to the unexpected and awkward situation they created, and instead, they are attributing her behavior to a supposed flaw in her personality.

Furthermore, the daughter's behavior is not necessarily indicative of her being ungrateful or spoiled.

Fundamental Attribution Error,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently.

In other words, people tend to attribute someone's behavior or characteristics to their internal dispositions, such as their personality, character, or intentions, rather than to external factors, such as their environment, circumstances, or social context.

In the given example, the author is making an attribution about his girlfriend's behavior, specifically her choice of friends. He observes that many of her friends have disabilities or struggles, and he infers that this might be because she has low self-esteem and seeks out relationships with people who are ""worse off"" than her. This inference is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as the author is attributing his girlfriend's behavior to her internal disposition (low self-esteem) rather than considering alternative explanations, such as:

* Her friends are a diverse group of people, and their disabilities or struggles are not the defining characteristic of their relationships.
* She values inclusivity, empathy, and kindness, and seeks out friendships with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
* Her social circle is not solely defined by her friendships, and she may have other friends who do not have disabilities or struggles.

The author's attribution is also problematic because it implies that his girlfriend's self-esteem is somehow deficient or flawed, and that she needs to seek therapy or support to address this issue. This kind of attribution can be stigmatizing and dismissive of his girlfriend's experiences and perspectives.

Furthermore, the author's behavior in this situation is not only an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error but also a demonstration of a lack of empathy and understanding. He is making assumptions about his girlfriend's motivations and feelings without considering her own perspective or experiences. His suggestion that she needs therapy or support to address her supposed low self-esteem is also paternalistic and dismissive of her autonomy.

In conclusion, the author's behavior and attribution in this situation are indeed an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as he is overestimating the role of his girlfriend's internal disposition (low self-esteem) and underestimating the impact of situational factors (her values, social context, and relationships).

",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors in shaping behavior. In other words, people tend to attribute someone's behavior to their character or disposition, rather than considering the circumstances that may have influenced their actions.

In the given example, the father's reaction to the few drops of water on the floor is an extreme overreaction, and he attributes his daughter's behavior to her being a ""disgustingly dirty person."" This attribution is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as the father is ignoring the situational context (a few drops of water on the floor after a shower) and instead attributing his daughter's behavior to her supposed character flaws.

The father's behavior is also an example of a broader pattern of blame and criticism, which can be damaging to relationships and self-esteem. By labeling his daughter as ""disgusting"" and predicting that her boyfriend will eventually realize this, the father is making a negative attribution about his daughter's character, rather than considering the possibility that she simply had wet shoes after a shower.

In terms of the daughter's response, it's understandable that she felt numb and upset by her father's harsh words. Her decision to clean the floor and then retreat to her room to cry suggests that she was feeling hurt and overwhelmed by the situation. While some might argue that she should have stood up for herself or responded to her father's criticism, it's also possible that she was simply trying to avoid escalating the situation or causing further conflict.

It's also worth noting that the boyfriend's decision to leave after the father's outburst suggests that he may have been uncomfortable with the situation or felt that it was not a healthy or supportive environment.

In conclusion, the father's attribution of his daughter's behavior to her supposed character flaws is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. The daughter's response to the situation, while perhaps not confrontational, is understandable given the circumstances.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

In this context, the boyfriend is making personal judgments about Rachel Zegler, attributing her behaviors and expressions to her personality (""full of herself,"" ""too smug"") without considering external factors or the nuances of her individual experiences or circumstances.

However, the primary focus here seems less on the attribution of Rachel Zegler's behaviors and more on a perceived discomfort with confident women. In this case, the analysis centers on the boyfriend’s reactions and potential biases rather than attributing Zegler's behavior to her personality. The storyteller speculates that the boyfriend is uncomfortable with confident women and is projecting that discomfort onto Zegler by critiquing her personality.

While there are elements of attribution—specifically, the boyfriend attributing Zegler's expressions and confidence to negative personal traits—the broader context and point of discussion seem to be the boyfriend’s potential bias and discomfort rather than a straightforward instance of the fundamental attribution error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is a psychological concept where people tend to overemphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while underestimating situational influences on those behaviors. In other words, when evaluating others’ actions, one might attribute those actions to their character or disposition rather than considering situational factors that could have driven their behavior.

In the example provided, there's an indication that the social circle of the person telling the story might be committing the FAE. The storyteller initially lies about owning a fancy couch, a behavior that appears deceptive. As the truth unravels, people around them attribute this action to their character (""the couch liar""), branding them as untrustworthy or manipulative. They might not fully consider the situational factors: the social pressure to feel accomplished, the desire to fit into a group that seems to have its life together, or the impulse decision made in a specific social setting that spiraled out of control.

However, the emphasis in this narrative is on the storyteller's self-awareness and reflection of their own actions and the consequences that followed. The example showcases an internal struggle and recognition of the mistake made, as well as the perception of other's reactions, rather than a clear demonstration that others actively engaged in the FAE. While there is potential for the social circle to engage in this error, the example primarily focuses on the individual's realization and the natural outcomes of their actions.

Given this analysis, it's not strongly focused on others making disposition-based attributions over situational ones. Thus, it's not a clear-cut instance of the FAE as demonstrated.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Essentially, it's when people attribute others' actions to their character rather than considering external factors that might be influencing their behavior.

In the provided scenario, the father's behavior could be interpreted in the context of the Fundamental Attribution Error. He accuses you and your wife of being ""fat and lazy,"" which is a dispositional attribution—he is attributing your behavior or vacation suggestion to your personal traits (laziness and perhaps lack of cleanliness). On the other hand, your explanations about work hours, having a toddler, and managing two houses suggest situational factors that could account for the lifestyle choices and conditions he is criticizing. Thus, the father's comments could be seen as an instance of FAE because he's focusing on personal traits rather than external circumstances.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

The narrative provided doesn't offer a third-party perspective or an observation of such attribution made by others toward the ""Rude Lady.""

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"The scenario you presented does not primarily exemplify the concept of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). The Fundamental Attribution Error refers to the tendency for people to overemphasize personality-based explanations for behavior observed in others while underemphasizing situational explanations. In other words, it's when people attribute someone's actions to their character rather than to external factors or context.

In this scenario, the focus is on a decision made by an individual to pursue a passion for singing at the expense of a more conventional and secure career path. The narrative describes a person who comes from an artistically inclined family and has a passion for singing, despite not being very talented. Friends are concerned about the decision, but there's no clear indication that they attribute his decision to pursue music to an inherent flaw in his character, rather than the situational influences like family support and personal passion.

The complexity of the situation involving personal ambition, family influence, and social feedback is acknowledged, but there is no evident attribution of his decision to an internal characteristic (such as irrationality or stubbornness) rather than these external and situational factors.

Therefore, since the situation described does not inherently illustrate the over-attribution of the individual's actions to personal dispositions over situational ones, this is not a clear example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

In simpler terms, it's when people attribute someone else's actions to their character rather than considering external factors that may have influenced their behavior.

In this situation, you are upset with your parents for making a scene at your cousin's wedding by putting the focus on your birthday. You expressed to them how you felt humiliated and would have preferred a different form of celebration. In turn, your parents became upset with you, labeling you as ungrateful and spoiled. 

We can analyze the situation for Fundamental Attribution Error by examining the potential reasons for your parents' actions. It is possible to argue that your parents are attributing your reaction to being an ungrateful and spoiled person, instead of considering situational factors such as your feelings of awkwardness or your desire to maintain the focus on your cousin’s wedding. However, the example does not clearly state this is the reasoning behind their beliefs, it only states their reaction.

Since the narrative doesn't thoroughly explore the parents' understanding of your perspective or detail their reasoning beyond their disappointment, the example doesn't fully provide a clear instance where FAE is explicitly recognized or obvious. Therefore, without a more direct indication that they considered your personal demeanor exclusively over situational factors, it's difficult to definitively conclude that this is a classic case of FAE.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gpt-4o,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

In other words, it's when someone attributes another person's actions to their character or disposition rather than considering external factors or circumstances that might have influenced that behavior.

In the example you provided, the person questions why his girlfriend, whom he regards highly, seems to have friends who mostly have visible struggles or differences. He attributes this pattern to a potential intrinsic quality or flaw in her—namely, low self-esteem—believing that it might drive her to associate with people whom he perceives as ""worse off."" This could indeed reflect a fundamental attribution error if the person overlooks other situational factors, such as different life experiences or shared interests, that could explain her choice of friends.

By jumping to conclusions about her self-esteem and seeking psychological explanations for what he observes, the individual in the example could be seen as focusing on dispositional rather than situational explanations for her social circle. He does not consider other factors that might contribute to whom she befriends, such as shared values, experiences, or personality compatibility, beyond what he perceives as the struggles of her friends.

Therefore, the example does illustrate a tendency to attribute his girlfriend's choice of friends to her character trait (low self-esteem) without considering a broader or more situational understanding of her friendships.

The narrator believes her boyfriend is attributing Rachel Zegler's behavior (e.g., expressing opinions on Snow White) solely to internal factors like being ""full of herself"" and ""smug.""

He is not considering that Zegler's actions might be influenced by things other than a flawed character.

However, the Fundamental Attribution Error is usually applied to specific actions by individuals rather than global judgments of a person's character. It's about explaining a specific action more so than generalized negative feelings toward someone.

I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

In this scenario, the question is whether the *friends* are committing the fundamental attribution error in their response to the ""couch liar."" Let's examine this.

*   **Dispositional Attribution (Friends' Perspective):** The friends are attributing the liar's behavior to a flawed character. They see them as manipulative, untrustworthy, and fake, which are stable, internal traits.

*   **Situational Factors (Actual Scenario):** The liar gives a pretty candid account in which they mention they ""just wanted to feel like I had something nice...

While the liar took it too far with their lies, it's clear their motivation for starting was to impress their friends and not feel inadequate.

The friends, in their reactions, seem to downplay the situational factors that could have contributed to the liar's actions (insecurity, social pressure) and instead focus on character flaws. *They are* overemphasizing the liar's internal traits (""manipulative,"" ""fake"") and underemphasizing the possible situational pressures that led to the initial lie and the subsequent escalation.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

However, the narrator doesn't explore any potential situational factors that might have contributed to the woman's behavior. We don't know if the woman was having a particularly bad day, felt stressed, or had any other underlying reason for her behavior. While the woman's actions were certainly inappropriate, the narrator immediately jumps to a dispositional explanation (she's just a rude person) rather than considering any possible situational context.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is the tendency to overemphasize dispositional (internal) factors as explanations for other people's behavior and underestimate the role of situational (external) factors. It often involves attributing someone's actions to their personality traits or inherent abilities, rather than considering the context or circumstances they are in.

In the provided text, the narrator and their friends are reacting to the friend's decision to pursue singing full-time, despite perceived lack of talent and successful career. The question is whether their shock and worry stem from an overemphasis on internal factors while ignoring potentially relevant external factors. It could be argued that they are focusing on the friend's perceived lack of talent as a personality trait (""he's terrible at singing"") instead of considering potential external factors such as his upbringing in a supportive artistic family, the intrinsic motivation he derives from singing, his belief in hard work, or the possibility (however slim) that he could improve with dedicated practice.

However, this is not a clear case of FAE. The friends are acknowledging that the person's family has always encouraged his passion. They do seem to be focusing on his perceived lack of ability as a primary reason for his potential failure, which could indicate a disregard for external factors like the competitive nature of the music industry, the role of luck, or the possibility of developing his skills. However, we don't know what the friends are not considering, only what they are considering. Because of this, it is difficult to ascertain whether FAE is at play.

Fundamental Attribution Error,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error involves attributing someone's behavior to their personality or disposition, rather than considering situational factors. In this case, the question isn't about someone observing *another person's* behavior and making an incorrect attribution. It's about the original poster (OP) describing a situation and evaluating their parents' behavior and their reaction to it. The parents are upset that the OP isn't appreciative of their actions, and the OP is upset that her parents embarrassed her and possibly overshadowed her cousin's wedding. The conflict arises not from a misjudgment of character, but from differing values and expectations about birthdays and wedding etiquette.

The parents' actions can be interpreted through different lenses (e.g., cultural differences, a desire to express love, lack of awareness).

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

The Fundamental Attribution Error is when we tend to attribute others' behaviors to their internal characteristics/personality while underestimating situational factors. In this case, the girlfriend (the narrator) is doing the opposite - she's looking beyond her boyfriend's surface-level complaints about Rachel Zegler's personality traits (which would be FAE if she accepted them at face value) and instead recognizing that his behavior likely stems from broader situational and societal factors (his discomfort with confident women, internalized patriarchal attitudes, etc.).

The boyfriend might be exhibiting FAE by attributing Zegler's behavior entirely to her personality (""full of herself,"" ""smug,"" etc.) while ignoring contextual factors that might influence her public persona or how she presents herself.

Fundamental Attribution Error,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

People are wild.",0,"This situation appears to be an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Here's why:

In observing the woman's behavior, the narrator and readers are likely to attribute her actions to internal, dispositional factors (her being a ""Karen,"" entitled, or generally a rude person) rather than considering potential situational factors that might have influenced her behavior.

While the woman's behavior is clearly inappropriate, situational factors that could have contributed might include:
- She might have been having a particularly stressful day
- She might have physical limitations making certain carts more difficult to use
- She might have been rushing due to other commitments
- She might have been experiencing other personal issues affecting her judgment

Instead, the story emphasizes character-based explanations, suggesting she's just naturally entitled or rude (describing her as a ""Karen,"" focusing on her clothing suggesting privilege, and highlighting her apparently habitual behavior of abandoning carts).

The storyteller and readers are more likely to conclude ""this is just how she is"" rather than considering temporary situational influences, which is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"This situation does appear to be an example of Fundamental Attribution Error, but from the opposite perspective than we might initially think. The narrator and friends are actually exhibiting this bias in their reasoning.

The Fundamental Attribution Error occurs when we attribute someone's behavior primarily to their internal characteristics (personality, ability) while underestimating situational and environmental factors.

In this case, the narrator and friends are:
1. Attributing the friend's decision primarily to his lack of talent or poor judgment
2. Overlooking significant situational factors that might be influencing his decision, such as:
   - Family environment that strongly values artistic pursuit
   - Consistent encouragement from well-meaning strangers
   - The stress and time constraints of his current career path
   - The social support system that has always validated his artistic interests

While the concerns about his singing ability may be valid, the fundamental attribution error appears in how they're framing his decision as purely a result of his personal shortcomings or delusions, rather than considering the complex web of environmental and social factors that have led him to this point.

Fundamental Attribution Error,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"This situation doesn't appear to be an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). FAE occurs when people tend to overemphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors while underestimating the influence of situational factors when explaining others' actions.

In this scenario, the narrator (the 18-year-old) is actually doing the opposite of FAE. She's considering the situational factors that led to her parents' behavior (their desire to make her birthday special, their excitement about the surprise) while not making broad character judgments about them. Even when disagreeing with their actions, she focuses on the specific behavior rather than attributing it to fundamental character flaws.

Meanwhile, the parents' reaction of calling their daughter ""ungrateful"" and a ""spoiled brat"" might be closer to FAE, as they're attributing her negative reaction to personality traits rather than considering the legitimate situational reasons why she might be upset (concern for her cousin, feeling of embarrassment, etc.).

However, the main conflict described here isn't primarily about attribution of behavior, but rather about different views on appropriate social conduct and celebration timing.

Fundamental Attribution Error,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0,"This is a clear example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. The person is attributing his girlfriend's friendships to an internal characteristic (low self-esteem) rather than considering situational or external factors that could explain her diverse friend group. He's making sweeping assumptions about her personality and mental state based on who her friends are.

Some important points that demonstrate this:

1. He jumps to conclusions about her character (having low self-esteem) rather than considering simpler explanations like:
- She's naturally inclusive and open-minded
- These friendships formed organically through shared interests or experiences
- She values people for who they are, not their physical characteristics

2. He's making internal attributions about her mental state (""looks badly at herself"") based on surface-level observations about her friends' physical characteristics or identities.

3. He fails to consider external factors that might explain these friendships, such as:
- Shared workplace or social environments
- Common interests or hobbies
- Natural social connections that develop over time

This is a textbook case of someone overemphasizing internal, dispositional factors (her supposed low self-esteem) while ignoring situational factors that could explain the behavior.

",0,"This scenario appears to actually showcase the Fundamental Attribution Error from the father's perspective. Here's why:

The Fundamental Attribution Error occurs when we attribute someone's behavior to their personal characteristics or personality while underestimating the influence of situational factors. In this case:

1. The father observes a minor incident (a few water drops on the floor)
2. Instead of seeing it as a situational occurrence (just coming from shower, wet shoes), he attributes it to his daughter's fundamental character (""disgusting,"" ""dirty person"")
3. He goes further by generalizing this single incident to predict her future behavior (""he will realize this once we marry"")

The father is taking a single, minor situation and using it to make broad, negative conclusions about his daughter's personality and character. This is a classic example of Fundamental Attribution Error because he's ignoring the situational context (just showered, accident) and instead attributing it to permanent personality traits.

Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0," ANSWER: Yes

The scenario you've described is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). This cognitive bias occurs when people make assumptions about others' behavior based on internal, dispositional characteristics rather than external, situational factors.

In this case, your boyfriend is attributing Rachel Zegler's behavior to her personality traits (e.g., being full of herself, smug, laughing too loud) instead of considering the possibility that his reaction might be influenced by his own discomfort with a confident, political, and expressive woman. He's judging her based on his personal preferences and biases, rather than objectively evaluating her actions or the situation.

Furthermore, his statement about feminism being unappealing if it's not ""cute and likable for dudes"" suggests that he's attributing the perceived flaws of feminism to the behavior of individual women, rather than recognizing that feminism is a social and political movement with a wide range of expressions and approaches.

Overall, it seems that your boyfriend is demonstrating the Fundamental Attribution Error by attributing Rachel Zegler's behavior to her personality traits and judging her based on his own biases, rather than considering the situation and external factors that might be influencing her actions.",,yes,

AIO for reporting a lazy delivery person?

In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot. Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. This cognitive bias occurs when individuals make hasty judgments about a person's character or disposition, rather than considering the situational factors that may have influenced their behavior.

In this case, the individual assumed that the delivery person was lazy based on the fact that the order couldn't be delivered. However, there could be numerous reasons for the delivery issue, such as traffic, route changes, or unexpected obstacles, that the individual was not aware of. By attributing the delivery failure solely to the delivery person's laziness, the individual is committing the Fundamental Attribution Error.

It's essential to consider that people's actions are often influenced by external factors and circumstances, and it's crucial to avoid making quick judgments about a person's character based on a single incident. Instead, it's more productive to gather more information and try to understand the context before making assumptions.",,yes,
Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The example you provided is a clear instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. In this situation, you attributed your friends' and family's reactions to your lie about the new couch as being primarily due to their personal characteristics (e.g., being manipulative, fragile, or fake) rather than the situation (e.g., you lied about having a new couch). This is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, where people tend to overestimate the role of dispositional factors (personality traits) and underestimate the role of situational factors in explaining others' behavior.

In your case, you assumed that your friends and family's reactions were due to their personal characteristics, rather than the situation you created by lying about the couch. This led you to feel misunderstood and judged, and it ultimately resulted in damaged relationships. The Fundamental Attribution Error can lead to misattributions of others' behavior, which can have negative consequences for interpersonal relationships.",,no,

My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Is this normal? What the heck do I do? I just feel sick about it and I can't make myself think straight.",0," ANSWER: Yes

The exchange you described appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). The FAE is a bias in attribution that occurs when people tend to overestimate the role of dispositional factors (internal traits or characteristics) and underestimate the role of situational factors (external circumstances) in explaining other people's behavior.

In this situation, your father attributed your suggestion of a lakehouse or Airbnb vacation to your laziness and lack of concern for breakfast, rather than considering the possibility that you might have suggested it because you wanted a more relaxed and self-catered vacation experience. He also attributed your wife's work schedule and the state of your house to laziness, without considering the situational factors that might have contributed to those circumstances (e.g., the demands of working and caring for a toddler).

By attributing your behavior to internal traits rather than situational factors, your father was committing the Fundamental Attribution Error. This error can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and negative judgments of others, as was the case in this situation.

It's important to note that the FAE is a common cognitive bias that affects many people, and it can be difficult to overcome. However, being aware of the bias can help you to avoid falling into the trap of making similar errors in your own attributions. In this situation, it might be helpful to try to understand your father's behavior from a situational perspective, rather than attributing it to personal traits that you perceive as negative.

In terms of what you can do, it may be helpful to have a conversation with your father about the incident and express your feelings and concerns. It's important to approach the conversation in a calm and non-confrontational manner, and to focus on the specific behaviors that you found hurtful or offensive, rather than making global judgments about your father's character. It may also be helpful to seek support from other family members or friends, or to speak with a therapist or counselor if the incident continues to cause you distress.",,no,

I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

The Fundamental Attribution Error occurs when we attribute other people's behavior to their internal traits (like personality, motives, or character) rather than external factors (like the situation, context, or social pressures). In this example, the Rude Lady is exhibiting the Fundamental Attribution Error by attributing the behavior of taking and refusing to give back the shopping cart to the internal trait of the other person (being disrespectful or unwilling to give up the cart). She assumes that the other person is being selfish and disrespectful, rather than considering external factors such as the crowded store, the limited availability of shopping carts, or the other person's need to use the cart to carry their groceries.

The situation you've described seems to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). FAE is a cognitive bias that occurs when we attribute other people's actions to their internal traits (e.g., ability, character) rather than external factors (e.g., situation, luck).

In this case, you're attributing your friend's decision to pursue singing full-time as a result of his inherent talent or lack thereof (internal factor), rather than considering external factors such as his passion, family support, or the opportunities he might have in the arts industry.

Additionally, you're also falling into the FAE by assuming that his lack of success on social media is due to his lack of talent (internal factor), rather than external factors such as the competitive nature of the platform, the quality of his promotion efforts, or the algorithms that determine what content gets seen.

If you're considering telling him that he's terrible at singing and songwriting, it's important to remember that such feedback, especially if it's not constructive, could potentially harm his self-esteem and motivation. Instead, you could offer to help him improve his craft, provide constructive feedback, or discuss other aspects of his plan, such as his financial situation, marketing strategy, or backup plan.

In summary, while it's understandable that you might be concerned about your friend's decision, it's important to avoid making assumptions about his talent based on your personal biases, and to approach the situation with empathy and a desire to help, rather than to criticize.",,no,

I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). The FAE is a cognitive bias that occurs when we attribute other people's actions to their internal traits or dispositions, while underestimating or ignoring the possible role of external factors or situational pressures.

In your case, your parents attributed your preference for a smaller, more private celebration to your being ungrateful or spoiled, rather than considering the context and the potential embarrassment you might have felt due to the unexpected public celebration during your cousin's wedding. They assumed that your behavior was a reflection of your character, rather than a response to the specific situation. This is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.",,no,
Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The scenario you've described is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). FAE is a bias in attributing others' behavior to internal, dispositional traits, rather than external, situational factors. In this case, you are attributing your girlfriend's friendships to her having low self-esteem, rather than considering the possibility that her friends may have formed their friendships with her due to shared interests, experiences, or mutual support. This bias is particularly evident when you suggest that she forms relationships with people who are ""worse off"" than her to make herself feel better. This implies that your girlfriend's self-worth is dependent on the perceived status of her friends, which is a stereotypical and potentially harmful assumption. Instead, it would be more beneficial to approach the situation with empathy and curiosity, asking your girlfriend about her friends and their relationships, and avoiding making assumptions based on external factors.",,yes,

",0," ANSWER: Yes

The situation you've described appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. This cognitive bias occurs when individuals attribute others' behavior to internal, permanent, and dispositional traits, rather than considering the role of situational factors.

In your case, your father's reaction to a few drops of water on the floor seems to be an overreaction based on his internalized perception of you as a ""disgusting"" and ""disgustingly dirty person."" He attributes your behavior (leaving a few drops of water on the floor) to your supposed character flaws, rather than considering the context or situational factors (you were in a hurry, it was a minor issue, etc.).

Additionally, his comments about you being a ""disgustingly dirty person"" that your boyfriend will realize once you marry suggest that he is making a sweeping judgment about your character based on a single incident, which is another example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

It's important to note that while your father's behavior is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, it does not mean that you are not allowed to feel upset or hurt by his words. Your feelings are valid, and it's understandable that you would feel upset and want to leave the situation.

In the future, it may be helpful to communicate with your father about his behavior and how it affects you, and to try to understand his perspective while also asserting your own. However, it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to seek support from others if needed.",,yes,
Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

The **FAE** refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational influences when explaining someone else’s behavior. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic and you assume they’re a rude person (dispositional) rather than considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational), that’s FAE.

In this scenario, your boyfriend isn’t misattributing Rachel Zegler’s behavior to her personality while ignoring situational factors. Instead, he’s **criticizing her personality traits directly** (e.g., calling her ""smug,"" ""full of herself"") and interpreting her actions (like her comments about *Snow White*) as evidence of these traits. There’s no clear mismatch between dispositional and situational explanations here—he’s just judging her harshly based on her expressed opinions and demeanor. 

What you’re describing seems more like **misogyny**, **projection**, or **hostile sexism** (e.g., policing women’s confidence, framing feminism as unlikable, assuming women must perform femininity in a way that pleases men). Your boyfriend isn’t misattributing her behavior; he’s actively disliking her for traits he perceives as violating gendered expectations.

Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0,"This example appears to be an instance of the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**. Here's why:

The Fundamental Attribution Error occurs when someone attributes another person's behavior to their internal characteristics (e.g., laziness, incompetence) while overlooking situational factors that may have influenced the behavior. In this case, the person assumes the delivery worker was ""lazy"" and made ""zero effort"" without considering possible external reasons for the failed delivery (e.g., traffic, bike issues, incorrect address, time constraints, or even a system error on Amazon's part). The immediate jump to blaming the delivery person's character (""lazy"") rather than exploring situational explanations fits the definition of FAE.

Additionally, the emotional reaction (fury, seething) and the swift reporting of the worker suggest a strong internal attribution without evidence of the worker's intent or circumstances. The fact that the photo doesn't even show the worker's face further underscores the lack of concrete justification for the accusation.

Thus, this is a clear case of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**, let's first define the concept. The FAE refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational influences when explaining someone else's behavior. In other words, it's when we assume someone's actions reflect their character (e.g., ""they lied because they're a liar"") rather than considering external pressures or circumstances (e.g., ""they lied because they felt socially pressured"").

In the given example, the narrator's friends and family are judging them harshly for lying about the couch, labeling them as ""the couch liar"" and assuming manipulative or fragile character traits. They are attributing the behavior to the narrator's personality (e.g., being fake, manipulative, or untrustworthy) rather than considering situational factors, such as the social pressure to fit in, the desire to feel ""okay,"" or the spontaneous nature of the initial lie. This fits the definition of the Fundamental Attribution Error because the social circle is overemphasizing dispositional explanations and underemphasizing situational ones.

However, it's worth noting that the narrator's lies did have real consequences, and some level of distrust is understandable. But the extreme reaction (e.g., losing friendships, being labeled) suggests an over-attribution to character flaws rather than a balanced view of the situation.

Thus, this is an example of others committing the Fundamental Attribution Error against the narrator.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Is this normal? What the heck do I do? I just feel sick about it and I can't make myself think straight.",0,"To determine whether this example involves the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**, let's first define the concept. The FAE refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational influences when explaining someone else's behavior. In other words, it's when someone assumes another person's actions are due to their inherent character (e.g., laziness, selfishness) rather than considering external circumstances (e.g., stress, fatigue, or practical constraints).

### Analysis of the Example:
1. **Dad's Behavior**:  
   - Your dad attributes your suggestion of renting a lakehouse or Airbnb to you and your wife being ""too fat and lazy.""  
   - He ignores potential situational reasons for your preference (e.g., wanting space for a toddler, preferring a home-like environment, or avoiding crowded hotels).  
   - He also generalizes your housekeeping habits as evidence of laziness, disregarding the challenges of raising a toddler or the division of labor in your household (e.g., your wife's demanding work schedule).  

2. **Dispositional vs. Situational**:  
   - Your dad is fixated on **dispositional explanations** (your ""laziness"" or lack of discipline) rather than considering **situational factors** (your TBI, your wife's work hours, the realities of parenting a young child).  
   - This aligns with the FAE because he's blaming your character rather than exploring contextual reasons for your choices or behaviors.  

3. **Counterarguments**:  
   - You point out situational factors (your wife's work schedule, your TBI, the normality of a messy house with a toddler), but your dad dismisses them, doubling down on his dispositional judgments.  

### Is This the Fundamental Attribution Error?  
Yes, your dad is committing the FAE by persistently attributing your behavior to negative personality traits (""lazy,"" ""fat"") while ignoring situational explanations. His refusal to acknowledge context or your perspective is classic FAE.  

### Additional Notes:  
- Your reaction (feeling hurt, overwhelmed, and questioning whether this is ""normal"") is understandable. His comments are harsh, personal, and dismissive of your reality.  
- This isn't just about FAE; it also involves **verbal abuse** (repeatedly calling you fat/lazy) and **invalidating your experiences**. Even if he believes his criticisms are ""truth,"" they’re reductive and unfair.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

People are wild.",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**, let's first define the concept. The FAE refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational influences when explaining someone else's behavior. In other words, it's assuming someone acts a certain way because of who they are, rather than considering external factors that might be influencing their actions.

In the Walmart scenario, the narrator describes the ""Rude Lady"" as behaving entitled, stubborn, and unreasonable—insisting on taking a cart that clearly isn't hers, making absurd claims about ""better wheels,"" and complaining about younger generations. The narrator attributes the lady's behavior to her personality (e.g., being a ""Karen,"" entitled, or disrespectful) without considering possible situational factors that might explain her actions. For example:
- Could the lady be stressed or distracted by something unrelated (e.g., a personal issue)?
- Could she genuinely believe the cart was hers due to confusion or memory lapse?
- Could cultural or generational differences play a role in her expectations?

The narrator doesn't entertain these possibilities and instead jumps to labeling the lady as inherently rude. This is consistent with the FAE, where the focus is on dispositional traits rather than situational context.

However, it's worth noting that the lady's behavior *does* seem objectively unreasonable, which might make the attribution feel justified. But the FAE isn't about whether the attribution is *correct*—it's about whether situational factors are ignored in favor of personality-based explanations. Here, they are.

Thus, this is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"To determine whether this example involves the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**, let's first define the concept. The FAE refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits or internal characteristics (e.g., ""he's delusional"" or ""he's stubborn"") when explaining someone's behavior, while underemphasizing situational or external factors (e.g., ""his family's artistic background influenced him"" or ""social media algorithms make it hard to succeed""). 

In this scenario:
1. **Internal Attribution**: The friends (and possibly the poster) might attribute the guy's decision to pursue singing full-time to his personality—e.g., being stubborn, delusional, or overly passionate. They might think, ""He’s ignoring reality because he’s too proud or naive.""
2. **External Attribution**: However, there are clear situational factors at play: his family's artistic background, the positive reinforcement he’s received (from friends and strangers), and the societal narrative of ""follow your dreams"" that downplays practical barriers. These external influences likely shape his behavior as much as (or more than) his personality.

The FAE would occur if someone (like the poster or friends) primarily blames the guy’s *character* (""he’s irrational"") while overlooking the *situation* (family support, social media culture, etc.). The friends seem to focus on his stubbornness or lack of self-awareness, which leans toward internal attribution. 

That said, the FAE isn’t the central theme here—it’s more about whether the poster would be wrong to intervene. But if we’re strictly asking whether the FAE is present in how people are interpreting his actions, the answer is **yes**, to some extent. The friends are likely underestimating the situational pressures and overestimating his personal traits as the sole driver of his decision.

I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0,"This example does **not** appear to be an instance of the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**. Here's why:

The **Fundamental Attribution Error** refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational factors when explaining someone else's behavior. In this case, the original poster (OP) is making an assumption about their girlfriend's **character** (low self-esteem) based on the types of friends she has, rather than considering possible situational or alternative explanations (e.g., she might simply be a compassionate person who values diversity, or she might have met these friends through shared experiences or communities). 

However, the OP's reasoning goes beyond just misattributing behavior—it involves a **judgmental assumption** about their girlfriend's motivations (seeking friends who are ""worse off"" to feel better about herself). This is more of a **stereotyping** or **unfounded psychological analysis** rather than a pure FAE, which would involve misinterpreting a specific action as stemming from personality rather than context.

The FAE would be more relevant if, for example, the girlfriend was quiet in a social setting and the OP assumed she was ""shy"" (dispositional) rather than considering she might be tired (situational). Here, the OP is making a broader, more intrusive judgment rather than misinterpreting a single behavior.

Thus, while there is an element of attributing behavior to personality (low self-esteem), the situation is more complex and less textbook FAE.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"I am 19 female and I have a boyfriend who comes every saturday night to have dinner with my family and me. My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?

",0,"This example does **not** appear to be an instance of the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**. Here’s why:

The **Fundamental Attribution Error** refers to the tendency to overemphasize personality traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational factors when explaining someone else's behavior. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might assume they’re a rude person (dispositional) rather than considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational).

In your scenario:
- Your father attributed your wet shoes and the drops on the floor to you being a ""disgusting and dirty person"" (a dispositional judgment). 
- However, he overlooked situational factors (e.g., the shoes were only slightly wet, it was an accident, you cleaned it up promptly). 

While this might seem like FAE at first glance, the key distinction is that FAE typically involves **misattributing behavior to personality in a general or habitual sense**, whereas your father’s reaction seems more like an **exaggerated, emotionally charged criticism** rather than a systematic overemphasis on personality traits. His comments were harsh and personal, but they don’t clearly illustrate the cognitive bias of FAE, which is more about misjudging behavior in a broader context.

To your other questions:
- You were **not** an asshole or childish. Your reaction was understandable given the unfair and hurtful criticism. 
- Whether you ""should have stayed"" depends on your needs in the moment—removing yourself from a toxic interaction was a valid choice.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Hmm. So first, I need to recall what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is. From what I remember, FAE is the tendency for people to overemphasize personal characteristics (like personality traits) and underestimate situational factors when explaining other people's behavior. So when someone does something, we often think it's because of who they are, not considering the situation they're in.

Now, looking at the example. The boyfriend is ranting about Rachel Zegler, criticizing her for being ""full of herself,"" ""smug,"" laughing too loud, etc. He attributes her comments (like saying Snow White was scary) to her personality—she's disrespectful, arrogant, etc. The user thinks that the real issue is the boyfriend's discomfort with confident, outspoken women. So the boyfriend is focusing on Rachel's personality traits (dispositional factors) instead of considering possible situational reasons or his own biases (situational factors).

Wait, but FAE is about how we judge others. So in this case, the boyfriend is judging Rachel's behavior (her comments and expressions) as stemming from her personality (she's smug, full of herself) rather than considering external factors. But the user is suggesting that the boyfriend's own discomfort (situational factors related to his own views on women) is the real reason he's reacting this way. But how does that map onto FAE?

Alternatively, maybe the boyfriend is committing FAE by attributing Rachel's actions to her personality (she's arrogant) instead of considering the context (maybe she's being playful, or her comments were taken out of context, or cultural factors). But the user's analysis points more to the boyfriend's own issues (his discomfort with confident women) as the situational factor he's ignoring. Wait, but FAE is when someone else's behavior is explained by their traits rather than their situation. Here, the boyfriend is explaining Rachel's behavior as due to her traits. But the user is pointing out that the boyfriend's reaction is due to his own issues (situational factors for him? Or dispositional factors in him?).

Hmm. Let me think again. FAE is when you explain someone else's behavior based on their personality rather than their situation. The boyfriend is attributing Rachel's actions (her comments, expressions) to her being ""full of herself"" (personality) rather than considering that maybe she's in a situation where she's being candid, or that her comments were a joke, or part of an interview context where she was asked a question. So the boyfriend is committing FAE by not considering the situational factors surrounding Rachel's behavior.

The user's perspective is that the boyfriend's own issues (his discomfort with confident women) are the real reason he's reacting this way, but that's a different point. The FAE here would be the boyfriend's attribution of Rachel's behavior to her personality rather than the situation. So the example does involve FAE because the boyfriend is making a dispositional attribution about Rachel without considering possible external factors. Therefore, the answer would be yes.
</think>

The scenario described does involve the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**. FAE occurs when someone overemphasizes personal traits (dispositional factors) to explain another person’s behavior while ignoring situational or contextual influences. In this case, the boyfriend attributes Rachel Zegler’s comments (e.g., calling Snow White scary as a child) and demeanor (e.g., laughing loudly, being expressive) to her personality traits like being “smug,” “full of herself,” or “disrespectful.” He interprets her behavior as inherently arrogant or attention-seeking without considering situational factors that might explain her actions, such as the context of her statements (e.g., childhood fear, candidness in interviews) or broader societal dynamics (e.g., women being scrutinized for confidence).

The boyfriend’s critique fixates on Zegler’s perceived character flaws while dismissing the possibility that her behavior could stem from situational factors (e.g., cultural shifts in how women express themselves, the pressures of public visibility, or even harmless personal preferences). Instead of engaging with these nuances, he reduces her actions to negative personality traits. This aligns with FAE because he prioritizes dispositional explanations over situational ones. 

The user’s observation that the boyfriend’s reaction reflects his discomfort with confident women introduces an additional layer. While this critique highlights systemic biases (e.g., patriarchal norms), it does not negate the presence of FAE. The boyfriend’s focus on Zegler’s personality (dispositional attribution) rather than contextual factors (situational attribution) remains a textbook example of the error. His insistence that the user “doesn’t actually like” Zegler and is merely performatively defending her further underscores his tendency to attribute others’ behaviors to fixed traits (e.g., “feminist posturing”) rather than genuine, context-driven opinions.

AIO for reporting a lazy delivery person?
I was absolutely furious! I just had to report this person because there was zero effort made on their part. In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot. Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Hmm. So first, I need to remember what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is. From what I recall, FAE is when people tend to overemphasize personal characteristics (like personality traits) and underestimate situational factors when explaining someone else's behavior. Like, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a jerk (dispositional) instead of considering maybe they're rushing to the hospital (situational).

Now, looking at the example. The person is angry because their order wasn't delivered. They reported the delivery person as lazy, saying there was zero effort. They took a photo of the person biking away (face not visible) and reported them to Amazon. They're wondering if they overreacted.

So the key here is the assumption that the delivery person was lazy (a dispositional trait) without considering possible situational factors. The FAE would be if the accuser didn't think about things like maybe the delivery person had an emergency, the address was wrong, the package was misplaced, or maybe there were other obstacles like traffic, bike problems, etc. Instead, they immediately attribute the failure to deliver to the person's laziness (internal factor).

The person here is furious and blames the delivery person's lack of effort. But are there possible external factors they're ignoring? The delivery person's face isn't visible, so maybe it's not even the same person. Or perhaps there was a system error. The situation happened quickly, and the reporter acted in anger. So their immediate conclusion is about the delivery person's character (lazy) without considering other possibilities.

Therefore, this scenario does seem to fit FAE. The person attributes the delivery failure to the worker's internal traits (laziness, lack of effort) rather than considering external factors that might have caused the issue. Unless there's more info about the situation that the person is aware of, but based on what's given, they jumped to a dispositional judgment.
</think>

The example provided does appear to be an instance of the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**. The FAE occurs when someone attributes another person’s behavior to internal, dispositional factors (e.g., personality traits like laziness) while overlooking situational factors that might explain the behavior. In this scenario, the individual assumes the delivery person’s failure to deliver the package is due to “zero effort” and laziness, without considering external circumstances that could have contributed to the outcome. For instance, the delivery person might have faced logistical issues (e.g., incorrect address, time constraints, bike malfunction), safety concerns, or even a system error unrelated to their effort. The individual’s anger and immediate focus on the worker’s perceived lack of effort—despite having no direct evidence of their intentions or the broader context—align with the FAE. Additionally, the haste of the reaction (acting “in a few minutes” while “seething”) suggests a reliance on snap judgments about the delivery person’s character rather than a balanced assessment of possible situational factors.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether this example is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is. From what I recall, FAE is the tendency for people to overemphasize personal characteristics (like personality or motives) and underestimate situational factors when explaining other people's behavior. So when someone else does something, we tend to think it's because of who they are, not because of the situation they were in.

Now, looking at the example given. The person lied about buying a couch to fit in during a conversation where everyone was talking about their home upgrades. The lie spiraled out of control, leading to loss of trust and friendships. The person admits they don't know why they lied but wanted to feel like they were doing okay. 

The question is whether others (friends, family) committing FAE when judging the person. Wait, but the scenario is told from the liar's perspective. The friends and family found out the lie, and now they see the person as a liar, untrustworthy, etc. So when the friends attribute the lying to the person's character (like being manipulative or fake) rather than considering the situational factors (like social pressure to fit in, feeling inadequate), that would be FAE. 

But in the story, the friends are reacting to the person's actual actions—they lied repeatedly. The person even admits that the friends aren't wrong in their judgment. The friends are focusing on the person's dishonesty (a character trait) rather than the situation that led to the initial lie. But wait, FAE is when observers attribute others' behavior to their character rather than the situation. In this case, the friends are attributing the behavior (lying) to the person's character (being a liar), but the person's actual reason was situational (feeling pressure to fit in). So if the friends think the person lied because they're a dishonest person (dispositional) and ignore the situational factors (social pressure, insecurity), then that would be FAE. 

But the example doesn't explicitly state that the friends are making that error. The friends are reacting to the behavior, but the story is from the liar's perspective. The key here is whether the friends are committing FAE by not considering the situational factors. However, the example might not show FAE because the friends are responding to actual repeated lies, which are intentional actions. FAE is more about misjudging a single action. For instance, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a jerk (dispositional) rather than considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational). 

In this case, the person lied multiple times and created an elaborate story. The friends are judging based on the person's actions, which were deliberate and sustained. The FAE would apply if the friends thought the person was inherently a liar without considering the situational pressures that led to the initial lie. But if the friends are reacting to the pattern of behavior (which does reflect on character), then it's not necessarily FAE. The FAE is more about a single instance being attributed to character. 

Alternatively, maybe the example is about the person's own attribution. Wait, no. The question is whether the example is an instance of FAE. The scenario describes the consequences of lying, but the FAE would involve others misattributing the cause of the lie. The example's focus is on the liar's experience, but the FAE would be the observers' error. The friends are labeling the person as a liar (dispositional) without considering the situation (like wanting to fit in). So if the friends are making that error, then yes. But the story doesn't show the friends dismissing the situation. They might just be reacting to the lying, which is a character issue. 

Alternatively, if the friends thought the person lied because they're a manipulative person (dispositional) instead of considering that it was a one-time mistake under social pressure (situational), that's FAE. But the person kept lying multiple times, which makes it more of a character issue. So maybe the friends aren't making an error here. The FAE occurs when the situation is ignored. If the friends knew about the situational factors but still blamed the person's character, that's FAE. But if they don't know the reasons (the person said they don't even know why they lied), then they can't consider the situation. So the friends are attributing to character because that's all they see. 

In that case, maybe there's no FAE here. Because FAE requires that the observers ignore situational factors in favor of dispositional ones. If the situational factors are not known, then it's not an error. The example's friends might not have enough information about the situation (like the person's internal feelings) to consider it. So their attribution to the person's character isn't an error because they don't have the situational context. 

Therefore, the example does not illustrate FAE. The friends are reacting to the person's actions, which are indeed indicative of dishonesty. Since the situational factors (the person's internal pressures) aren't evident to the friends, their judgment isn't an error. FAE would be if they dismissed clear situational factors. So the answer is no.
</think>

The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when observers overemphasize dispositional factors (e.g., personality, character) and underestimate situational influences when explaining someone else's behavior. In this example, the friends and family attribute the person's repeated lying to traits like being ""manipulative"" or ""fake,"" labeling them as ""the couch liar."" However, the situational context—such as social pressure to fit in, feelings of inadequacy, or the initial impulse to participate in a group conversation—is not explicitly acknowledged or considered by the observers. 

Crucially, the FAE hinges on observers *ignoring* situational factors in favor of dispositional ones. Here, the friends are reacting to a sustained pattern of deception (e.g., fabricating shipping delays, scams) rather than a single impulsive lie. The repeated lies make it reasonable for observers to infer dishonesty as a character flaw, especially since the situational motivations (e.g., insecurity) are not visible or communicated. The friends lack insight into the internal pressures driving the behavior, so their judgment focuses on the observable actions. Without clear evidence that the friends dismissed situational factors they were aware of, their attribution does not meet the criteria for FAE. Instead, their conclusions align with the behavioral evidence available to them.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the described situation is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). First, I need to recall what FAE is. From what I remember, FAE is when someone attributes another person's behavior to their character or personality (internal factors) rather than considering situational factors. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic and you think they're a jerk (internal) instead of considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational).

Looking at the example given: The dad calls the son and his wife ""too fat and lazy"" because they suggested renting a lakehouse/Airbnb instead of a hotel. The dad's reasoning seems to be that their preference is due to their laziness (internal traits) rather than considering possible situational reasons. The son points out that his wife works six days a week, they have two houses, etc., suggesting their choice isn't about laziness but perhaps convenience, managing a toddler, or other factors.

The dad attributes their suggestion to being lazy (internal) without considering the context. The son feels this is unfair because there are valid situational reasons. The dad is making a dispositional attribution (their character) instead of looking at external factors. That fits FAE. Also, the dad's comment about the house not being clean enough (attributing it to their laziness rather than having a toddler) is another instance. He's not considering the situation (toddler making mess) but blaming their character.

So yes, the dad is committing FAE here. He's focusing on internal traits (lazy, fat) instead of external circumstances. The son's reaction is defending by pointing out the situational factors, which aligns with the FAE concept.
</think>

The scenario described involves the father attributing the son's preference for a rental property (like a lakehouse or Airbnb) to internal, dispositional factors—specifically labeling the son and his wife as ""too fat and lazy""—rather than considering situational factors that might explain their choice. The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when someone overemphasizes personality-based explanations for others' behavior while underemphasizing situational or contextual factors. Here, the father assumes laziness (an internal trait) is the reason for the suggestion, ignoring potential situational factors such as the desire for flexibility with a toddler, cost considerations, or the practicality of a rental space for a family group. 

Additionally, the father doubles down by criticizing the cleanliness of their home, again attributing it to laziness rather than acknowledging the challenges of managing a household with a young child. The son counters by pointing to situational factors (e.g., his wife’s demanding work schedule, the realities of parenting a toddler), which the father dismisses. This mismatch—focusing on character flaws instead of context—aligns with the FAE. The father’s refusal to engage with external explanations and his insistence on internal moral failings (""it’s true and I’m just telling the truth"") further exemplify this cognitive bias.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

People are wild.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether this Walmart cart incident is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is. From what I recall, FAE is when people attribute someone else's behavior to their personality or disposition (like being rude or selfish) rather than considering situational factors that might have caused the behavior. So, instead of thinking ""maybe they're acting this way because of the situation,"" you think ""they're just a bad person.""

In the example given, the lady is being super rude, claiming the cart is hers when clearly it's not. The narrator attributes her actions to her being a ""Karen"" and rude in general. The employee probably thinks she's just difficult. But according to FAE, the error would be if the observer (the narrator here) assumes the lady's behavior is due to her personality (she's a rude person) and ignores possible situational factors.

Wait, but in the story, the lady's behavior is pretty clearly not justified by the situation. She's lying about the cart being hers, making up excuses about coupons and wheels. The narrator doesn't consider any situational reasons for her behavior, like maybe she's stressed, had a bad day, or is confused. Instead, the narrator labels her as a ""Karen"" and focuses on her personality. The employee also doesn't mention any situational factors; he just tells her to take another cart. 

So the Fundamental Attribution Error here would be if the narrator (and others) attribute the lady's actions to her character (she's a rude person) without considering external factors. But in this case, are there any situational factors that could explain her behavior? The lady's own explanation (coupons, better wheels) doesn't make sense in the context. She might just be entitled or have a personality that leads her to act this way. But FAE is about the observer making the error. The narrator's account doesn't explore possible situational reasons. For example, maybe the lady has a cognitive issue, or maybe she's under some stress. But the story doesn't present any such factors. The narrator and the employee assume she's just being difficult. 

Alternatively, maybe the lady's behavior is so clearly a result of her disposition (entitlement, rudeness) that there's no situational factor to consider. If there's no possible situational explanation, then it's not FAE. FAE is when you ignore possible situational factors. If there are no such factors, then it's a correct dispositional attribution. But in reality, there's almost always some situational influence. However, in the story as presented, the lady's actions are baseless and seem entirely on her. The narrator doesn't even consider that maybe the lady was confused (situational), but the lady's own statements (about coupons, wheels) suggest she's making things up. So the narrator attributes her behavior to her being a rude person, not considering any external factors. 

Therefore, this would be an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error because the narrator is explaining the lady's behavior as due to her personality (being a Karen, rude) without considering possible situational factors that might have influenced her actions, even if those factors aren't obvious in the story. The error is in the attribution, not whether the attribution is correct. Even if the lady really is just a rude person, the FAE occurs when the observer doesn't consider situational factors. But wait, the FAE is about overemphasizing dispositional factors and underemphasizing situational ones. If there's no plausible situational factor, then it's not an error. 

Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The lady's claim that the cart is hers (with the coupons and wheels) is clearly false. So the situational factors she cites are made up. But maybe the real situational factors are something else. For example, maybe she's in a hurry, stressed, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But the narrator doesn't consider those. The narrator just thinks she's a rude person. So the error here would be making a dispositional attribution without considering possible situational causes. But in reality, maybe the lady is acting this way because she's stressed about something else. The narrator doesn't think that. So yes, this is FAE. Alternatively, if the lady's behavior is entirely due to her disposition (she's just a rude person), then the correct attribution is dispositional, and there's no error. 

But the key point of FAE is that people tend to ignore possible situational explanations. The error is in the observer's judgment. So even if the actual cause is dispositional, the error occurs when the observer doesn't consider situational factors. Wait, no. FAE is when the observer attributes behavior to disposition when it's actually caused by the situation. But if the behavior is truly caused by disposition, then it's not an error. But in reality, we can't know for sure. The FAE is the tendency to default to dispositional attributions even when situational factors are present. 

In this case, the lady's behavior seems to be entirely dispositional. The narrator doesn't present any situational factors. However, the narrator's own attribution (she's a Karen, rude) is a dispositional attribution. If the narrator didn't consider possible situational factors (even if there are none in reality), then according to FAE, that's an error. But if there are no situational factors, then it's not an error. 

But FAE is about the tendency to overlook possible situational factors. The question is whether the example is an instance of FAE. Since the story is told from the narrator's perspective, and the narrator attributes the lady's behavior to her personality (without considering any situational reasons), even if there were none, that would be FAE. But maybe in this case, there's no possible situational factor. For example, the lady's claim about the coupons and wheels is a lie. So the only possible factors are her personality. But maybe the lady is confused (situational) but the narrator doesn't consider that. The narrator assumes it's her personality. 

Alternatively, the lady's behavior is so outlandish that it's clearly a personality issue. But FAE is about the observer's attribution. If the observer doesn't even consider situational factors, that's the error. However, in reality, if there's no evidence of situational factors, the attribution might be correct. But the error is the tendency to default to dispositional. 

So in the example, the narrator and the employee attribute the lady's behavior to her being rude (dispositional). They don't consider that maybe she's stressed, confused, or something else (situational). Therefore, this is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

The scenario described can be analyzed through the lens of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE), which involves overemphasizing dispositional factors (e.g., personality traits) while underemphasizing situational factors when explaining someone’s behavior. In this case, the narrator attributes the woman’s actions entirely to her being a ""Karen"" or inherently rude, focusing on her perceived entitlement or personality flaws. The employee also dismisses her behavior without exploring potential situational explanations. 

While the woman’s claims (e.g., coupons, better wheels) are clearly unfounded and her actions appear unjustified, the FAE arises because neither the narrator nor the employee considers possible situational factors that might explain her behavior. For instance, stress, confusion, cognitive issues, or external pressures (e.g., personal emergencies) could theoretically contribute to her irrational demands. However, the narrator immediately labels her as rude and entitled, defaulting to a dispositional attribution without acknowledging any context beyond the immediate interaction. 

Even if the woman’s behavior is ultimately rooted in her personality, the FAE occurs when observers fail to account for situational influences, regardless of whether such influences exist. The narrator’s focus on the woman’s character (e.g., ""Karen-level tone,"" ""decline of respect in younger generations"") exemplifies this tendency to overlook situational possibilities, even if they are not explicitly evident in the story. Thus, the example aligns with the FAE framework due to the lack of consideration for external factors in explaining the woman’s actions.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. First, I need to remember what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) actually is. From what I recall, FAE refers to the tendency people have to overemphasize personal characteristics (like personality or disposition) and underestimate situational factors when explaining other people's behavior. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a jerk (dispositional) rather than considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational).

Now, looking at the example here. The person in question is quitting his job and school to pursue singing, despite not being very talented. His friends and family have supported him, perhaps not giving honest feedback. The friends are worried but think he needs to make the mistake himself. The author is considering telling him he's not good, but others say it's best to let him try.

The key here is whether the FAE applies. The FAE would involve attributing his decision to his personality (like being stubborn, overly passionate) without considering situational factors. Wait, but in this case, the friends might be attributing his decision to his personality traits (like his family's artistic background, his own passion) rather than considering situational factors that might be influencing his choice. Alternatively, maybe the friends are the ones making the FAE when they judge him. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The FAE is when someone else's behavior is explained by their character rather than the situation. In the example, the main person (the singer) is attributing his lack of success to not working hard enough (i.e., situational factors like time invested), but others (the friends) think the problem is his lack of talent (a dispositional factor). Wait, but that might not be FAE. Wait, the FAE would be if observers (the friends) think his failure is due to his lack of talent (disposition) while ignoring situational factors. But in this case, the friends are saying he's not good (disposition), but he thinks he needs to work more (situational, like time constraints). Wait, but FAE is when you attribute others' behavior to their disposition. Let me clarify.

Wait, the FAE is about explaining others' behavior, not their outcomes. So if someone does something, you attribute it to their personality. For example, if he fails at singing, people might think it's because he's not talented (disposition) rather than considering that the music industry is tough (situational). But in the scenario, the friends think he's bad at singing (disposition) but the singer himself thinks he's not putting in enough effort (situational). The friends are assessing his failure (low views) as due to his lack of talent (dispositional), but maybe there are situational factors (like the algorithms on social media, competition, etc.). However, the main point here is the friends' judgment of his decision to quit his job. Are they attributing his decision to his personality (like being stubborn, influenced by his artistic family) instead of considering situational factors that led him to make that choice?

Alternatively, the FAE could be if the friends think he's making a bad decision because he's naive or overconfident (dispositional), without considering situational factors that might make his decision reasonable. But in this case, the friends are more focused on his lack of talent as the reason he'll fail, which is a dispositional attribution. The singer attributes his lack of success to not enough effort (situational). So perhaps the friends are committing FAE by attributing his failure to his inherent lack of talent (disposition) instead of considering other factors like the effort he's put in. Wait, but in reality, if he's truly untalented, that's a dispositional factor. However, FAE is about the observers' tendency to overemphasize dispositional factors. But in this case, the friends might be correctly assessing that his talent (disposition) is the issue. So maybe it's not FAE here. Alternatively, if the friends think he's making the decision because he's inherently stubborn or following his family's influence (dispositional) rather than considering situational pressures (like job stress, desire for creative fulfillment), then that could be FAE. But the main conflict here is whether his lack of success is due to talent (disposition) vs. effort (situational). Hmm.

Wait, the Fundamental Attribution Error is about how we judge others' behavior. For example, if someone is rude, we think they're a rude person (dispositional) rather than considering they might be having a bad day (situational). In the scenario, the friends are evaluating his decision to quit his job. Are they attributing that decision to his personality (artistic family influence, his passion) without considering situational factors (like his current job's time constraints, stress, etc.)? Or is the FAE not applicable here because the main issue is the friends' assessment of his talent, not his behavior?

Alternatively, maybe the FAE is present when the singer attributes others' lack of views to situational factors (not enough effort) rather than dispositional (his lack of talent). But FAE is about how we explain others' behavior, not our own. The FAE involves observers making dispositional attributions about others. So if the friends are attributing his failure (low views) to his lack of talent (disposition), but perhaps there are situational factors (like poor marketing, bad luck) that they're ignoring, then that's FAE. However, if the friends are correct in their assessment that his talent is the issue, then it's not an error. The FAE is about an error in attribution. So if the friends are accurately assessing his lack of talent, then there's no FAE. But if they're overlooking situational factors (like the difficulty of the music industry), then maybe. But the example states that his singing is weak and shaky, lyrics cliche. So the friends' assessment is based on actual dispositional factors. Therefore, their judgment isn't an error. Hence, the scenario might not involve FAE.

Alternatively, the singer himself might be making the FAE by attributing others' success to luck or situational factors and his own failure to not working hard enough. Wait, but FAE is about how we judge others, not ourselves. The actor-observer bias is when we attribute our own behavior to situational factors and others' to dispositional. So in this case, the singer's own explanation (needs to work harder) is situational, but if he were to judge someone else in his position, he might think they're not talented (dispositional). But the question is about whether the example is an instance of FAE. The friends are considering telling him he's not talented (dispositional), but maybe they should consider situational factors. Wait, but in this case, the friends' assessment is accurate (he's not talented), so it's not an error. FAE is when the attribution is an error. If they thought he failed because he's lazy (dispositional) when really he's working hard but the industry is tough (situational), that would be FAE. But here, the friends correctly point out that his talent is the issue. Therefore, this isn't FAE. So the answer would be no.
</think>

The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when observers overemphasize personal traits (dispositional factors) and underestimate situational influences when explaining someone else's behavior. In this scenario, the friends and narrator are evaluating the decision of the man to pursue singing full-time despite his lack of talent. They attribute his failure to gain traction (e.g., low views on songs) to his inherent lack of skill (a dispositional factor) rather than considering situational factors like social media algorithms, market saturation, or luck. However, the friends' judgment appears grounded in observable reality (e.g., his ""weak and shaky"" voice, cliché lyrics), making their assessment more accurate than erroneous. The FAE typically involves misattributing behavior due to overlooking situational context, but here, the friends are not ignoring situational factors—they are acknowledging his persistent effort (e.g., releasing songs, seeking virality) and still concluding his limitations stem from dispositional shortcomings. Since their attribution aligns with observable evidence and does not reflect a clear oversight of situational influences, this does not qualify as FAE.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether this situation is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is. From what I recall, FAE is when people attribute someone's behavior to their character or personality (internal factors) rather than considering situational factors. Like, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a jerk (internal) instead of considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational).

Now, looking at the example given. The person's parents made a big deal about her birthday at her cousin's wedding, which she didn't want. She told them she felt humiliated and that they ruined the wedding. The parents got mad and called her ungrateful.

So, where's the FAE here? Let's break it down. The parents think she's ungrateful (internal attribution) because she didn't appreciate their surprise. They're assuming her reaction is due to her being a ""spoiled brat"" (personality trait) rather than considering the situational factors—like how awkward it was at the wedding, the fact that she didn't want the attention there, or that they changed plans without her consent. Instead of understanding the context, they attribute her reaction to her being ungrateful.

On the flip side, she might be attributing their actions to their character (like them being inconsiderate) instead of considering their intentions (they wanted to make her feel special, maybe they thought she was okay with it based on prior arrangements). But the main focus here is the parents' reaction. The parents are the ones making the FAE by not seeing the situational reasons for her being upset and instead blaming her personality.

Wait, but the question is whether the example is an instance of FAE. The key part is if the parents are committing FAE when they call her ungrateful. They're ignoring the situation (the awkwardness, the disruption at the wedding) and attributing her reaction to her being spoiled. That fits FAE. Alternatively, if the daughter is making an error in attributing the parents' actions, but the main conflict is the parents' accusation towards her.

Yes, the parents are making the FAE here. They're not considering the external factors (the context of the wedding, her expressed wishes) and instead are attributing her response to her internal traits (ungrateful, spoiled). So the example does involve FAE.
</think>

The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when individuals overemphasize personality-based explanations for others' behavior while underestimating situational factors. In this scenario, the parents accuse the narrator of being an ""ungrateful, spoiled brat"" for not appreciating their surprise birthday gesture at the cousin's wedding. This reaction aligns with FAE because the parents attribute the narrator's dissatisfaction to her inherent character flaws (e.g., being ""ungrateful"") rather than considering the situational context that explains her feelings. 

The narrator explicitly did not want attention diverted from the cousin's wedding and had agreed to a delayed celebration. The parents' surprise disrupted the wedding, caused embarrassment, and violated the narrator's clearly stated preferences. However, the parents ignore these situational factors (e.g., the awkwardness of hijacking a wedding, the narrator’s prior agreement to postpone celebrations) and instead attribute her reaction to internal traits like selfishness or ingratitude. Their failure to recognize the role of the environment and their own actions in causing the conflict exemplifies FAE. 

The narrator, conversely, does not commit FAE in her analysis. She acknowledges her parents' intentions (""they wanted to make her feel special"") but critiques their actions based on the situational impact (disrupting the wedding, disregarding her wishes). This demonstrates a balanced consideration of both intent and context, rather than attributing their behavior solely to personality flaws.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this situation is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. Hmm. So the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is when someone attributes another person's behavior to their character or personality (internal factors) rather than considering situational or external factors. Like, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a jerk (internal) instead of considering they might be rushing to an emergency (external).

In the scenario here, the guy (OP) notices that his girlfriend's friends are all people with disabilities or from marginalized groups. He then suggests that she has low self-esteem and that she's befriending these people to feel better about herself. He's attributing her choice of friends to her internal traits (low self-esteem, need to feel superior) rather than considering other possible reasons.

Wait, what other reasons could there be? Maybe the girlfriend is genuinely compassionate and values diversity. Maybe she works in a field where she meets a lot of diverse people, or she's part of a community that's inclusive. Or perhaps she just doesn't judge people based on their disabilities or identities and forms friendships based on mutual interests and respect. Those would be external or situational factors rather than her personality flaws.

The OP didn't consider these possibilities. Instead, he jumped to the conclusion that her friend choices stem from her low self-esteem. That sounds like FAE because he's making an internal attribution (her self-esteem issues) without considering external factors (like her values, environment, etc.). Also, he mentions she's on anxiety meds, which he uses to support his internal attribution, but that's still focusing on her personal issues rather than the situation.

Another angle: FAE involves overemphasizing personal characteristics and underemphasizing situational factors. Here, OP attributes her friendships to her supposed need to feel better about herself (internal) instead of considering that maybe her friends are just people she connects with regardless of their disabilities. So yes, this seems like FAE.
</think>

The scenario presented does indeed illustrate the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). The FAE occurs when someone explains another person's behavior by overemphasizing internal traits (e.g., personality, character) while neglecting situational or external factors. In this case, the boyfriend observes that his girlfriend’s friends belong to marginalized or disabled groups and concludes that her choice of friends stems from low self-esteem—a stable internal trait. He assumes she seeks relationships with people she perceives as ""worse off"" to bolster her own self-image, framing her actions as driven by personal insecurity rather than considering alternative explanations.

Possible situational factors he overlooks include her values (e.g., compassion, inclusivity), her social or professional environment (e.g., working in a field that attracts diverse individuals), or shared interests and genuine connections with her friends. By attributing her behavior to low self-esteem, he ignores these external or contextual reasons. Additionally, he uses her anxiety medication as further ""evidence"" of her internal flaws, reinforcing his focus on dispositional factors. His failure to engage with her perspective or explore situational explanations aligns with the FAE’s core mechanism of prioritizing internal over external attributions.

Fundamental Attribution Error,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I am 19 female and I have a boyfriend who comes every saturday night to have dinner with my family and me. My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?

",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. First, I need to remember what the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is. From what I recall, FAE is the tendency for people to overemphasize personal characteristics (like personality traits) and ignore situational factors when explaining other people's behavior. So, instead of considering the situation someone is in, they attribute the behavior to their inherent qualities.

Now, looking at the example. The scenario is about the user, a 19-year-old female, whose dad gets upset because she left a few water drops on the floor after coming downstairs with wet shoes. The dad calls her disgusting and makes her clean it, then tells her boyfriend that she's a bad, dirty person. The user felt upset and left, and now is questioning if she was wrong.

So, the key here is whether the dad is committing the FAE. The dad attributes her leaving water on the floor to her being a disgusting or dirty person (personal traits), rather than considering situational factors. The situational factors here could be that her shoes were a bit wet (maybe she didn't realize, or it was an accident), she just came out of the shower, maybe she was in a hurry, or the floor was easy to get wet. The dad isn't considering those possibilities; he jumps to labeling her character based on this one action.

The user's reaction—leaving and crying—is more about her emotional response. But the FAE is about the dad's judgment. The dad's comments to the boyfriend suggest he's making a dispositional attribution (her being a dirty person) rather than a situational one (her shoes were wet, it was an accident). That fits FAE because he's blaming her character instead of the situation.

Wait, but FAE is when someone else's behavior is attributed to their personality rather than the situation. In this case, the dad is judging the user's behavior (tracking water) as a reflection of her being a disgusting person. So yes, the dad is committing FAE. The user's own actions (like leaving) aren't part of the FAE here; the FAE is about how the dad is explaining her behavior.

So the example does involve FAE because the dad is making a personal, dispositional attribution for her minor mistake, not considering situational factors.
</think>

The example provided does indeed illustrate the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). The FAE occurs when someone attributes another person’s behavior to internal, dispositional factors (e.g., personality traits, character flaws) while overlooking situational factors that might explain the behavior. In this scenario, the father attributes the daughter’s wet floor to her being a ""disgustingly dirty person,"" framing her actions as a reflection of her inherent character. He focuses on her perceived flaws (e.g., ""bad,"" ""disgusting"") rather than considering situational explanations, such as the minor accident of a few water droplets from shoes that were only ""a bit wet."" By criticizing her character to her boyfriend and failing to acknowledge the triviality of the situation (e.g., the small number of drops, the possibility of an honest mistake), the father exemplifies the FAE. His judgment prioritizes personal traits over context, which is the hallmark of this cognitive bias.

The daughter’s emotional reaction (leaving to cry) and self-doubt (""Was I an asshole? Childish?"") are responses to her father’s harsh attribution, not instances of FAE themselves. The FAE here is strictly about the father’s skewed interpretation of her behavior. While her actions could be debated in terms of appropriateness (e.g., whether staying would have resolved the conflict), those questions are separate from the FAE analysis. The core issue is the father’s disproportionate attribution of malice or inherent dirtiness to a minor, likely unintentional act.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

He is attributing her behavior to her personality and character, suggesting that she is ""full of herself,"" ""too smug,"" and ""thinks she's smart,"" without considering the situational factors that might influence her behavior or opinions.

AIO for reporting a lazy delivery person?
I was absolutely furious! I just had to report this person because there was zero effort made on their part. In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot. Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error, also known as the correspondence bias, is the tendency for people to overemphasize dispositional or personality-based explanations for others' behavior while underemphasizing situational explanations. In the example provided, the individual reporting the delivery person as lazy is making a dispositional attribution, assuming that the person's behavior is due to their inherent laziness rather than considering situational factors that might have influenced the delivery failure.

Situational factors could include a variety of circumstances such as incorrect address information, unexpected road closures, vehicle breakdowns, or other unforeseen events that could prevent a delivery from being completed. Without considering these possibilities, the individual is focusing solely on the perceived lack of effort by the delivery person, which is a dispositional attribution.

Therefore, the example provided does appear to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as the individual is attributing the delivery failure to the personal characteristics of the delivery person (laziness) rather than considering situational factors that might have contributed to the outcome.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error is a social psychology concept that refers to the tendency to overattribute people's behaviors to internal characteristics and underattribute them to situational factors. In the example provided, the individual told a lie about purchasing a new couch and then found it difficult to maintain the lie as people began to ask to see it. This led to a series of escalating lies to cover up the initial deception.

The scenario described does not directly illustrate the Fundamental Attribution Error. Instead, it demonstrates the consequences of lying and the difficulty of maintaining a falsehood. The individuals in the story are reacting to the behavior (lying) rather than attributing it to the internal characteristics of the person who told the lie. The reactions of the friends and family seem to be more about the behavior itself and the breach of trust rather than making an attribution about the person's character or disposition.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Is this normal? What the heck do I do? I just feel sick about it and I can't make myself think straight.",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error, also known as the correspondence bias, is the tendency for people to overemphasize dispositional or personality-based explanations for the observed behaviors of others while underemphasizing the role of situational factors. In simpler terms, it's when we attribute someone's behavior to their inherent characteristics rather than considering the situation they are in.

In the scenario you've described, your father's comments about you and your wife being ""too fat and lazy"" to stay in a hotel rather than a lakehouse or an Airbnb are an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error. He is attributing your choice to stay in a rental property to your supposed laziness and weight, rather than considering that there might be other situational factors influencing your decision, such as a desire for a more family-friendly or cost-effective option, or perhaps a preference for a more personalized vacation experience.

Your father's behavior in this situation demonstrates a clear overemphasis on dispositional factors (your supposed laziness and weight) while ignoring the situational context (the family discussion about vacation options). This is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

People are wild.",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error, also known as the correspondence bias, is the tendency for people to overemphasize dispositional or personality-based explanations for observed behaviors while underemphasizing situational explanations. In the scenario you described, the Rude Lady's behavior could be seen as an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error if she is attributing your possession of the cart to a negative dispositional trait (such as being disrespectful or inconsiderate) rather than considering the situational factors (you found the cart in use and had no reason to believe it was reserved for someone else).

However, the scenario as described does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the Rude Lady is making a Fundamental Attribution Error. Her behavior could simply be a result of her own misunderstanding or misremembering of where she left the cart, or it could be an instance of entitlement or rudeness without necessarily attributing negative traits to you. Without more context about her thoughts and attributions regarding your behavior, it is not possible to confirm that she is committing the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"The scenario you've described does not directly illustrate the Fundamental Attribution Error. The Fundamental Attribution Error is a concept in social psychology that describes the tendency to overemphasize the role of personal characteristics and underemphasize situational factors when explaining others' behavior. In other words, it's the error of attributing someone's actions primarily to their personality or disposition rather than considering the context or circumstances that might influence their behavior.

In the case of your friend who is dropping out of school to pursue singing, the focus is more on the judgment of his decision and the potential consequences rather than on attributing his behavior to his personality or disposition. The concern is about whether he has the talent and the realistic prospects for success in a very competitive field, rather than attributing his decision to a personal flaw or lack of situational awareness.

Your concern seems to be rooted in the fear that your friend is not recognizing the situational factors that might be influencing the reception of his music (such as the difficulty of gaining visibility in a crowded market) and is instead attributing his lack of success to not putting in enough effort or time. This could be seen as an example of the actor-observer bias, where your friend might be attributing his own actions to external factors (not enough time or effort) while you and his other friends might be more focused on internal factors (lack of talent).

In summary, the situation you've described is more about differing perspectives on the reasons for his decision and the potential outcomes, rather than an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"In the scenario provided, the concept of the Fundamental Attribution Error can be seen in the parents' reaction to the situation. The Fundamental Attribution Error is the tendency to overemphasize dispositional or personality-based explanations for the observed behaviors of others while underemphasizing the role of situational factors. In this case, the parents attribute the child's reaction to ingratitude and being a ""spoiled brat"" (dispositional factors) rather than considering the situational factors that led to the child's discomfort.

The situational factors here include:
1. The celebration was taking place during a cousin's wedding, which was a significant event for the family and the cousin.
2. The child had explicitly planned a different celebration for their birthday to avoid overshadowing the cousin's wedding.
3. The child felt that the surprise celebration at the wedding was awkward and humiliating, which could have been avoided if the parents had considered the context of the wedding.

Given these situational factors, it would be more accurate to attribute the child's reaction to the context of the celebration rather than to their character. The parents' failure to consider these situational factors and instead focusing on the child's reaction as a reflection of their character is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error is a concept in social psychology that describes the tendency to overattribute the behavior of others to their internal characteristics or dispositions, while underestimating the influence of situational factors. In this example, the individual assumes that his girlfriend's choice of friends is due to her having low self-esteem, rather than considering other possible reasons for her social circle, such as shared experiences, interests, or values. This assumption reflects a bias towards attributing her behavior to her internal characteristics (low self-esteem) rather than situational factors (the context in which she formed friendships).

However, it's important to note that the Fundamental Attribution Error typically refers to attributing the behavior of others to their internal characteristics, while the example provided involves the individual making an assumption about his girlfriend's internal characteristics (low self-esteem) based on her choice of friends. This is more of a misattribution of her friends' characteristics to her own self-perception.

In summary, while the example does not perfectly align with the classic definition of the Fundamental Attribution Error, it does involve a similar kind of biased attribution, where the individual is making assumptions about his girlfriend's internal characteristics based on external observations.

",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error, also known as the correspondence bias, is the tendency for people to overemphasize dispositional or personality-based explanations for others' behavior while underemphasizing situational explanations. In other words, people tend to attribute others' actions to their inherent characteristics rather than to the circumstances they are in.

In the scenario you described, your father's reaction to the few drops of water from your shoes and his subsequent comments about you being ""disgusting"" and ""dirty"" could be seen as an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. He is attributing your behavior (which could be seen as a minor accident) to your inherent characteristics, suggesting that you are a ""disgustingly dirty person."" This overlooks the situational context that the drops of water were an accidental and minor occurrence, not a reflection of your personal cleanliness or character.

However, whether or not your father's behavior is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error depends on whether he consistently views your actions through the lens of your character rather than considering the specific circumstances. If this is an isolated incident and he typically takes situational factors into account, it may not be a clear case of the Fundamental Attribution Error. If, however, this is a pattern of behavior where he consistently attributes your actions to your character, it would be more indicative of the error.

As for your response to the situation, feeling numb and retreating to your room to cry is a natural emotional reaction to being criticized harshly and publicly. Whether or not you should have stayed is a matter of personal preference and comfort. It's important to consider your own well-being and the dynamics of your family relationships when deciding how to handle such situations in the future.

Black and White Thinking,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"The concept of Black and White Thinking refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual views situations, people, or events in absolute terms, often using extremes such as ""all or nothing,"" ""good or bad,"" or ""right or wrong."" This type of thinking can lead to oversimplification of complex issues and neglect of nuances.

In the given example, the mother's behavior can be seen as an instance of Black and White Thinking. She seems to be evaluating her daughter's actions based on a single criterion: whether or not she received a personalized Facebook post. Despite the daughter's efforts to spend quality time with her, take her to her favorite places, and give her gifts, the mother is dissatisfied because her expectation of a specific Facebook post was not met.

The mother's statement, ""if I don't do it, she must not mean all that much to me,"" illustrates this Black and White Thinking pattern. She is implying that the daughter's love and appreciation can be measured solely by the presence or absence of a Facebook post, disregarding the other thoughtful gestures made throughout the day. This type of thinking ignores the complexity of the situation and the various ways the daughter showed her love and appreciation.

Furthermore, the mother's reaction to being called out on her behavior, where she plays the victim and uses tears to manipulate others, is also a common trait associated with Black and White Thinking. By doing so, she is attempting to shift the focus away from her own behavior and onto her daughter's perceived shortcomings, rather than acknowledging and addressing the issue at hand.

In contrast, the daughter's response, while perhaps not ideal, acknowledges the complexity of the situation and expresses frustration at being expected to meet an unrealistic standard. She recognizes that her efforts to show love and appreciation are being dismissed in favor of a single, symbolic gesture.

Black and White Thinking,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"The concept of Black and White Thinking refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual views situations, people, or events in absolute terms, often using extreme language or categorizations. This can manifest in various ways, such as seeing people as either completely competent or utterly incompetent, with no middle ground.

In the given example, the husband's behavior and language appear to be a classic illustration of Black and White Thinking. He has a tendency to use extreme language, calling his wife ""incompetent"" on multiple occasions, even when her mistakes are relatively minor or understandable. This labeling of his wife as ""incompetent"" seems to be an oversimplification, as it disregards her many responsibilities, accomplishments, and strengths.

The husband's comments also demonstrate a lack of nuance and contextual understanding. He fails to consider the circumstances surrounding his wife's mistakes, such as the stress and pressure of planning a funeral, or the rarity of using a particular website, which led to her needing a password reset. Instead, he relies on absolute language, implying that his wife is inherently incompetent.

Furthermore, the husband's behavior is not limited to fair criticism, but rather crosses into verbal abuse. His use of derogatory language, such as calling his wife ""incompetent"" and being ""surrounded by f***ing incompetent people,"" is hurtful and demeaning. This type of language can have a profound impact on a person's self-esteem and emotional well-being.

It is essential to recognize that people are complex and multifaceted, with both strengths and weaknesses. The husband's Black and White Thinking prevents him from acknowledging and appreciating his wife's many positive qualities and accomplishments.

However yesterday when I got my birthday card I could tell most of it was ai generated. There was only one bit at the end that included a line that we say to each other that I knew was him.

This type of thinking is often characterized by dichotomous thinking, where things are either good or bad, right or wrong, with no middle ground.

In the given example, the speaker is struggling with the fact that their partner used AI-generated text in a birthday card. The speaker's initial reaction is one of sadness and disappointment, feeling that the card didn't feel genuine or real. They express a preference for a card that is ""from the heart,"" even if it's imperfect, over a polished but AI-generated message.

At first glance, it may seem like the speaker is engaging in Black and White Thinking, as they appear to be viewing the situation in absolute terms: either the card is genuine or it's not. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the speaker is actually acknowledging the complexity of the situation and considering multiple perspectives.

The speaker recognizes that their partner's intention was likely to make them happy, and that they may have used the AI-generated text as a way to improve their communication. The speaker also acknowledges that they would have preferred a more personal and heartfelt message, but they're not dismissing their partner's effort entirely.

In fact, the speaker is demonstrating a more nuanced and balanced thinking style, as they're weighing the pros and cons of the situation and considering their partner's motivations. They're not simply labeling the situation as ""good"" or ""bad,"" but rather exploring the gray areas in between.

Therefore, based on the speaker's thoughtful and multifaceted analysis of the situation, it does not appear to be an instance of Black and White Thinking.

Black and White Thinking,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

",0,"The concept of Black and White Thinking refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual views situations, people, or events in absolute terms, often categorizing them as either entirely good or entirely bad, with no middle ground or nuance. This type of thinking can lead to oversimplification and misinterpretation of complex situations.

In the provided example, the author expresses their enjoyment of giving thoughtful gifts to family members, which they believe demonstrates their positive regard for them. However, when they receive what they perceive as thoughtless gifts in return, they feel disrespected, foolish, and frustrated.

The author's reaction and interpretation of the situation can be seen as an instance of Black and White Thinking. They seem to be operating under the assumption that their family members' gifts are either thoughtful and meaningful (like their own) or completely thoughtless and insulting (like the Starbucks gift card and hot chocolate gift basket). This binary perspective leads them to feel like they are being ""laughed at"" or made a ""fool"" of, rather than considering alternative explanations or the possibility that their family members' gifts, although different from their own, may still hold value or thoughtfulness.

The author's use of phrases like ""I put zero time/effort into this"" and ""the kind of presents that say 'I put zero time/effort into this'"" further illustrates this Black and White Thinking pattern. They are attributing a negative intention to their family members' gifts, implying that they are lazy or uncaring, rather than considering the possibility that their family members may have had different priorities, budgets, or gift-giving styles.

Furthermore, the author's expectation that their family members should reciprocate with gifts of similar thoughtfulness and value creates a sense of entitlement and reinforces their Black and White Thinking. This expectation is not explicitly stated, but it is implicit in their feelings of disappointment and frustration.

In conclusion, the author's interpretation of the situation and their emotional response to the gifts they received from their family members demonstrate a clear instance of Black and White Thinking. They are viewing the situation in absolute terms, with no consideration for alternative perspectives or nuances.

Black and White Thinking,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact?

In the given example, the author's reaction to their mother throwing away the teddy bear can be seen as an instance of Black and White Thinking. The author perceives their mother's action as a personal attack, a thoughtless and hurtful gesture that disregards their sentimental attachment to the teddy bear. The author's response is intense and absolute, with no consideration for alternative perspectives or motivations.

The author's mother, on the other hand, may have viewed the teddy bear as a childish item that the author had outgrown, and throwing it away as a way to encourage the author to mature and let go of childish attachments. However, the author does not consider this perspective and instead reacts with extreme emotion, perceiving their mother's action as a malicious and hurtful act.

The author's thinking can be seen as Black and White because they:

1. View their mother's action as entirely bad and thoughtless, with no consideration for alternative motivations.
2. Perceive themselves as entirely justified in their reaction, with no acknowledgment of potential overreaction.
3. Fail to consider the nuances of the situation, such as their mother's potential intentions or the fact that the teddy bear was dirty and smelly.

The author's Black and White Thinking leads to an intense and dramatic reaction, which escalates the situation and creates conflict with their family members. The author's friend's support and validation may reinforce their Black and White Thinking, making it more challenging for the author to consider alternative perspectives and develop a more nuanced understanding of the situation.

Black and White Thinking,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

Thing is.. it doesn’t cross my mind to ask right away but i’ll eventually ask maybe that night after kids go to sleep.

I told her that i’d try harder but that it’s hard for me to program myself to remember to ask as soon as she gets home. She told me that I shouldn’t have to try and that it’s “normal” to just ask. She feels like I’m inconsiderate.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"The concept of Black and White Thinking refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual views situations, people, or events in absolute terms, with no middle ground or nuances. This thinking pattern is often characterized by the use of extreme language, such as ""always,"" ""never,"" ""everyone,"" or ""no one."" In the context of relationships, Black and White Thinking can lead to unrealistic expectations, misunderstandings, and conflicts.

In the scenario described, the wife's expectation that her husband should automatically ask about her evening as soon as she gets home can be seen as an example of Black and White Thinking. She seems to be operating under the assumption that a ""normal"" or considerate partner would always ask about her evening immediately, without fail. This implies that there is only one acceptable way to behave in this situation, and that any deviation from this expectation is unacceptable.

The husband's perspective, on the other hand, suggests that he is capable of showing interest and care, but not necessarily in the exact moment or manner that his wife expects. He is willing to ask about her evening, but perhaps not immediately, and this is not necessarily a reflection of his level of consideration or love for her.

The wife's statement that the husband ""shouldn't have to try"" and that it's ""normal"" to just ask implies that she is holding him to an unrealistic standard. This kind of thinking can create unnecessary tension and conflict in the relationship, as it fails to account for individual differences, circumstances, and communication styles.

In this case, it appears that the wife's Black and White Thinking is contributing to her perception that her husband is inconsiderate, when in fact, he may simply have a different communication style or priorities in the moment. A more nuanced understanding of each other's perspectives and needs could help to resolve this issue and strengthen their relationship.

Black and White Thinking,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"The situation described involves a boyfriend (M23) becoming frustrated and angry when he was unable to back out of a parking space. He refused help from his girlfriend (F21), who offered to spot him, and instead called his parents and complained about the situation. The girlfriend eventually convinced him to let her spot him, and they were able to leave the parking space within 2 minutes.

The concept of Black and White Thinking refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual views situations as either entirely good or entirely bad, with no middle ground. This type of thinking can lead to oversimplification of complex issues and an inability to consider alternative perspectives.

In this situation, the boyfriend's behavior and comments suggest that he may be engaging in Black and White Thinking. For example, when the girlfriend offered to spot him, he refused, stating that it wouldn't help him because the truck behind him wasn't there when he pulled into the spot. This statement implies that he viewed the situation as impossible to resolve, rather than considering the potential benefits of having his girlfriend spot him.

Additionally, when the girlfriend pointed out that he had ruined the night and the dinner she paid for, the boyfriend responded by blaming her for his frustration, stating that she should not have spoken to him while he was trying to find a solution. This response suggests that he viewed the situation as entirely the girlfriend's fault, rather than acknowledging his own role in escalating the situation.

The boyfriend's comments also imply that he has a tendency to view situations as either entirely his way or entirely the girlfriend's way, with no middle ground. For example, when he said that the girlfriend always tries to destroy any date or thing in general that he wants to do, just because it's not something she picks, he seemed to be implying that the girlfriend is always opposed to his ideas and that she is trying to sabotage him. This type of thinking is characteristic of Black and White Thinking, where individuals view others as either entirely supportive or entirely oppositional.

Overall, the boyfriend's behavior and comments in this situation suggest that he may be engaging in Black and White Thinking, which can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings in relationships.

Black and White Thinking,gpt-4o,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"The scenario described involves a disagreement between a daughter and her mother about the importance of a Facebook post on Mother's Day. The daughter feels that she showed appreciation through her actions throughout the day, including spending time and giving gifts to her mother. However, her mother perceived the lack of a personalized Facebook post as a sign that she does not mean much to her daughter. This situation exemplifies a form of Black and White Thinking, which is characterized by a tendency to see things in extremes or absolutes rather than understanding nuances or complexities.

In this instance, the mother's perspective seems to involve Black and White Thinking because she equates the lack of a specific gesture (a personalized Facebook post) with a lack of love or appreciation altogether, despite the other actions her daughter took to show care and gratitude. The mother's interpretation appears to be all-or-nothing, failing to recognize the different ways love and appreciation can be expressed beyond social media validation. She views the absence of this one element as negating all other acts of kindness her daughter demonstrated during the day.

Black and White Thinking,gpt-4o,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"The situation described in the example primarily revolves around the dynamics of a personal relationship and the language used in communication. Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where people see situations in extreme, binary terms—either all good or all bad, right or wrong, competent or incompetent—without recognizing any middle ground or nuances.

In this scenario, the husband’s tendency to label his wife as ""incompetent"" based on a few instances of forgetfulness or minor mistakes can be seen as an example of Black and White Thinking. By focusing solely on these isolated incidents and using them to define her overall capability or competence, he fails to consider the broader context of her abilities and contributions both at home and at work. This binary perspective disregards her successes and responsibilities, reducing her to extremes based on specific errors.

Therefore, the husband's response of labeling and verbal criticism suggests a pattern of seeing things in black and white, not acknowledging the middle ground or the complexity of his wife's capabilities. She describes herself as competent in many areas, but her husband's comments reduce her to an ""incompetent"" label, illustrating an all-or-nothing approach.

",0,"Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking or dichotomous thinking, is a cognitive distortion characterized by the tendency to see things in extremes, without recognizing any middle ground. It often involves categorizing experiences in binary terms, such as success or failure, good or bad, all or nothing, without acknowledging the complexities and nuances of reality.

In the given example, the individual describes a disappointing experience upon receiving gifts from family members that they perceive as less thoughtful than those they gave. This reaction could potentially indicate elements of Black and White Thinking, but it's important to analyze the nuances. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Binary Perception**: The individual feels like they have been mocked or are the ""butt of some joke"" due to the perceived lack of effort in the gifts they received. This reaction suggests they might be viewing the situation in stark terms, i.e., those gifts are entirely inadequate or offensive, not recognizing the possibility that the givers might have had different intentions or constraints.

2. **Emotional Reaction**: The feeling of being a ""complete fool"" and the intensity of the emotional response may reflect a tendency toward seeing the situation in all-or-nothing terms. The person views the situation as either having received thoughtful gifts or receiving meaningless ones, contributing to feelings of being undervalued.

3. **Complexity**: However, the individual’s admission that they ""wasn’t expecting much"" and the understanding that giving is not a quid pro quo situation demonstrate some awareness of the complexity of gift-giving dynamics. They acknowledge that their enjoyment comes from the act of giving rather than receiving reciprocally equivalent gifts.

4. **Seeking Alternative Narratives**: By asking for alternative narratives to reframe their perspective, the individual demonstrates a willingness to consider other viewpoints, which suggests an openness to move beyond binary thinking.

Given these considerations, while there are some elements of Black and White Thinking present in the emotional intensity and initial binary reaction to the gifts, the overall context also shows an effort to understand and reconcile these feelings, indicating complexity beyond strict dichotomous thinking.

I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"Black and white thinking, also known as dichotomous thinking, is a cognitive distortion where people view situations, experiences, or people in a binary way—either all good or all bad, with no middle ground. This kind of thinking can create problems in relationships and decision-making because it ignores the complexity and nuance of most situations.

In the scenario described, the primary issue revolves around a conflict between the individual (the writer) and her family about the sentimental value of a teddy bear. The writer feels hurt and upset that her mother threw away the bear, which she clearly communicated as a significant sentimental item. The subsequent family conflict involved yelling, crying, and grounding, which suggests strong emotions and a breakdown in communication.

However, this situation does not appear to be an instance of black and white thinking. The writer describes her actions and emotions in response to a perceived violation of personal boundaries and disregard for her sentimental attachment to the teddy bear. There is also reflection on whether her reaction was appropriate or an overreaction, showing she is considering multiple perspectives and the complexity of the situation, which contradicts the rigid perspective characteristic of black and white thinking.

The conflict itself stems from different valuations of the teddy bear's significance rather than an all-or-nothing assessment of the people involved as wholly good or bad. The writer's questioning of whether her reaction was justified indicates an openness to understanding and reconsidering her perspective, which further demonstrates an ability to see nuance.

Black and White Thinking,gpt-4o,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

Thing is.. it doesn’t cross my mind to ask right away but i’ll eventually ask maybe that night after kids go to sleep.

I told her that i’d try harder but that it’s hard for me to program myself to remember to ask as soon as she gets home. She told me that I shouldn’t have to try and that it’s “normal” to just ask. She feels like I’m inconsiderate.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"Black and white thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where people see situations in rigid extremes, rather than acknowledging the complexity and nuances. This mindset often categorizes situations or outcomes as completely one way or another, without acknowledging the middle ground.

In the given scenario, the wife seems to have a perspective that ""normal"" interaction includes immediately asking how her night was upon returning home. She interprets the lack of an immediate question as inconsiderate. This could be seen as somewhat rigid, but it's also important to consider that expectations in a relationship can vary widely and don't necessarily equate to black and white thinking. The husband's willingness to ask later does show a middle ground approach.

However, the core issue appears to be more about differing expectations in communication rather than a thinking error on either part. The wife's viewpoint may come from a place of valuing immediacy in sharing experiences, which many would consider normal, while the husband views his timing as reasonable due to habit or preference. 

There is no explicit evidence that the wife is completely ignoring the husband's point of view or that she is insisting that if he doesn't ask immediately, he doesn't care at all. If she were to believe that he either asks immediately or he doesn't care at all (without room for delayed understanding), that would more closely align with black and white thinking.

In this context, the situation seems to be more a matter of personal expectations and preferences rather than a strict example of black and white thinking.

Black and White Thinking,gpt-4o,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"The situation you described does indeed illustrate some aspects of Black and White Thinking, particularly in your boyfriend's mindset and reactions. Black and White Thinking, or all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where a person sees situations in extremes, with no middle ground or grey areas considered. 

In this scenario, your boyfriend demonstrates a black-and-white perspective:

1. **Unable to Find a Solution**: Your boyfriend perceives the parking situation as unsolvable under the current conditions (""no way we were getting out of the spot""), despite the availability of alternative approaches such as being spotted by you or moving the car carefully.
   
2. **Resistance to Help**: He outright rejects any compromise or assistance, such as your offer to help spot him, because accepting help seems to him as admitting failure or incompetence.

3. **Emotional Reaction**: His extreme emotional responses, like throwing his hat and sunglasses or calling his parents to complain, indicate stress often aligned with black-and-white perceptions where any adversity is exaggerated without considering practical solutions.

4. **Blaming Others**: Even when a solution is found, he continues to blame someone else (you) for the issue rather than reflecting on how he might have contributed to the problem.

Your comment towards the end, ""he always has to find a way to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks,"" also suggests a tendency towards seeing his actions as consistently negative, another form of binary thinking. 

While not every aspect of the situation fits perfectly into Black and White Thinking, the core elements of the boyfriend's reaction and your perception of his behavior align with this cognitive distortion.

Black and White Thinking,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"Black and White thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where a person sees things in absolutes, without considering any shades of gray. In this example, the mother exhibits black and white thinking. She seems to believe that if her daughter doesn't make a Facebook post specifically dedicated to her, then her daughter doesn't love or appreciate her. The daughter showing love and appreciation in other forms (gifts, activities, quality time) becomes irrelevant because it doesn't fit the mother's specific criterion of a Facebook post. The mother's perspective overlooks the spectrum of actions that demonstrate affection and reduces it to a single, all-or-nothing measure.

Black and White Thinking,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"Yes, this example demonstrates elements of black and white thinking, primarily exhibited by the husband. Here's why:

The husband uses the label ""incompetent"" as an all-encompassing descriptor for his wife based on a few specific instances of mistakes. This reflects black and white thinking because:

*   **Categorical Thinking:** He places his wife into the category of ""incompetent"" rather than acknowledging that she is capable in many areas but made some mistakes in specific situations. He ignores the nuances of her abilities.

*   **Ignoring Contradictory Evidence:** The wife's successful career, raising children largely on her own, and household responsibilities are all evidence against the label ""incompetent."" The husband ignores or downplays this evidence in favor of focusing on isolated mistakes.

*   **Extreme Language:** The use of ""f***ing incompetent"" reinforces the extreme, all-or-nothing nature of his thinking.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that the wife also uses black and white thinking to describe herself, saying ""While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot"".

In the provided example, there isn't a clear instance of the person using black and white thinking. The person acknowledges that their partner's intention might have been good (trying to make her happy) even though the method (using AI) was undesirable.

She does not frame the situation as ""completely good"" (appreciating the intention) or ""completely bad"" (rejecting the card and the partner entirely).

Black and White Thinking,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

",0,"Yes, this example demonstrates elements of Black and White Thinking. The individual in the post frames gift-giving and receiving as either deeply meaningful, thoughtful, and expressive of positive regard *or* completely devoid of meaning, effort, and essentially insulting.

The key indicator is the stark contrast the person draws between their carefully selected gifts and the gifts they received. They categorize their gifts as expressing love and consideration, while the others are defined as indicating ""zero time/effort."" The individual sees no middle ground or any other potential interpretations of the received gifts. For instance, the person doesn't consider the possibility that others were simply rushed, on a budget, or thought the gift card and hot chocolate basket were something they would genuinely enjoy.

This either/or categorization and the intense negative reaction based on this perception is a classic characteristic of Black and White Thinking. The individual feels like a ""complete fool"" because of the perceived lack of effort, indicating that the only two ways to interpret the situation are that either they are being appreciated or they are being mocked. The rigid categorization prevents any other possibilities being considered.

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Here's why:

*   **The Wife's Perspective (Potential for Black and White Thinking):** She frames the situation as a binary: either the husband asks *immediately* how the event went (good, considerate) or he's inconsiderate. She seems to believe that asking later doesn't count or is indicative of a lack of caring. Her statement that it's ""normal"" to ask right away is also a form of absolutist thinking, assuming that her way is the only right way. She doesn't seem to acknowledge that there might be valid reasons why the husband doesn't ask immediately, or that his caring might be expressed in other ways.

*   **The Husband's Perspective (Less Black and White):** The husband, while frustrated, isn't framing things in such absolute terms. He recognizes her desire, is willing to try to accommodate, and acknowledges that there is room for compromise. He expresses his view of not needing to ask straight away, and even mentions good communication and a healthy relationship, which implies a view that this isn't a monumental issue.

The *core* issue is an expectation not being met, where the wife seems to take the husband not asking straight away as a personal indictment on his caring. It is the wife's interpretation of this *behaviour* as inconsiderate, and her absolutist statement regarding *when* he should ask, that suggests *some* black and white thinking.

The mother is unable to see the gray area or middle ground. She's viewing the situation in extremes:
- Either she gets everything she wants exactly how she wants it (including a specific social media post)
- Or she's completely unloved/disrespected

This is classic black and white thinking because it:
- Ignores all the positive actions and genuine expressions of love
- Creates a false dichotomy (either perfect compliance or total rejection)
- Fails to acknowledge that multiple forms of showing appreciation can be valid
- Dismisses nuance and context

The mother's reaction demonstrates an inability to hold two thoughts simultaneously: that her daughter showed tremendous love and appreciation throughout the day, AND that she personally would have preferred an additional specific gesture on social media.

Black and White Thinking,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"This situation appears to be an example of black and white thinking on the husband's part. He's categorizing his wife as either completely ""incompetent"" or competent, with no middle ground or nuance. Here's why:

1. He's taking a few isolated mistakes (forgetting a phone number during a stressful time, making typos, having password issues) and using them to make a sweeping judgment about his wife's overall competence.

2. He's ignoring all evidence of her competence, such as:
- Successfully raising 3 children
- Managing the household alone while he traveled
- Performing well at work
- Being trusted as a mentor
- Successfully organizing parts of the funeral

3. He's not allowing for the fact that people can be competent in some areas while making occasional mistakes in others, or that competence exists on a spectrum rather than as an absolute state.

His characterization of her as ""incompetent"" represents an extreme, all-or-nothing view that doesn't account for the complexity of human capability and the natural occurrence of occasional mistakes.

This type of thinking is particularly problematic because it's being used as part of what appears to be verbal abuse, where isolated mistakes are being used to make sweeping negative characterizations of his wife's worth and abilities.

Black and White Thinking,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

3. Recognize their emotional response while maintaining composure
4. Are actively seeking other ways to interpret the situation
5. Show capacity for gradients of meaning (noting the difference between no gifts vs. thoughtless gifts)

While they're hurt by the perceived lack of effort in the gifts they received, they're not making absolute statements or dividing the situation into extreme categories. Instead, they're expressing disappointment while remaining open to other interpretations and seeking ways to reframe their experience.

The fact that they're asking for alternative narratives shows they're not stuck in rigid, polarized thinking patterns, which is what characterizes black and white thinking.

Black and White Thinking,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact?

The narrator is actually showing nuanced emotional processing and questioning their own reactions, which is the opposite of black and white thinking. They're asking if they might have overreacted, considering different perspectives (their friend's support vs. their family's disapproval), and acknowledging the complexity of the situation.

Black and white thinking would be more like ""My mom is pure evil and deliberately destroyed my happiness"" or ""Anyone who has a stuffed animal as an adult is completely childish"" - absolute statements without room for nuance.

Instead, this story shows someone processing a genuine emotional response to the destruction of a sentimental item, while also being self-reflective enough to question whether their reaction was proportionate. They're considering multiple viewpoints and emotional perspectives, which demonstrates more nuanced thinking.

Black and White Thinking,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

I told her that i’d try harder but that it’s hard for me to program myself to remember to ask as soon as she gets home. She told me that I shouldn’t have to try and that it’s “normal” to just ask. She feels like I’m inconsiderate.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"This appears to be an example of black and white thinking from the wife's perspective. She's viewing the situation in absolute terms by:

1. Asserting there's only one ""normal"" way to show interest (asking immediately)
2. Suggesting that if someone cares, they would automatically ask right away
3. Not acknowledging that different people can have different but equally valid ways of showing interest and care

The wife is creating a false dichotomy where either:
- You ask immediately = you care and are considerate
- You don't ask immediately = you don't care and are inconsiderate

In reality, there's a spectrum of ways people show interest and process information. Some people are immediate reactors, while others process things more gradually. Neither approach is inherently right or wrong, better or worse. The husband shows he does care by:
- Eventually asking about her experiences
- Being willing to try to adjust his behavior
- Maintaining open communication about the issue

This is a case where both partners could benefit from understanding that there isn't just one ""correct"" way to show interest and care.

Black and White Thinking,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"This situation displays elements of Black and White Thinking from multiple angles:

1. The boyfriend's perspective shows black and white thinking by:
- Believing there were only two options: either figure it out alone or be ""stuck""
- Refusing any help because he saw it as either being completely capable or completely incapable
- Viewing any assistance as a total blow to his ego rather than seeing it as normal cooperation

2. The girlfriend also shows some black and white thinking by:
- Describing the dinner as ""completely perfect"" before the incident
- Stating he ""always has to find a way to destroy any date"" (using absolute terms)
- Viewing the entire evening as ""ruined"" because of one bad incident at the end

The situation actually had multiple potential solutions and degrees of outcomes, but both parties tended to view things in extremes rather than seeing the nuanced reality of the situation.

Black and White Thinking,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Lastly, the individual struggles to find a middle ground in their feelings about the card, either interpreting it as a thoughtful gesture or a failed attempt to impress them, without considering the possibility that it could be both.

The individual's reaction in this situation can be considered an instance of Black and White Thinking. Black and White Thinking, also known as dichotomous thinking, is a cognitive distortion where one sees things in absolute terms, without considering the shades of gray or the complexity of a situation.

In this case, the individual perceives the act of throwing away the teddy bear as an intentional and malicious act by their mother, without considering other possible explanations or circumstances. They view their mother's action as completely unacceptable and unforgivable, and their reaction is extreme, causing a scene and causing tension within the family.

Additionally, the individual's reaction is all-or-nothing, with no room for compromise or understanding. They see themselves as the victim and their family as the villains, without considering the perspectives and feelings of others involved. This rigidity in thinking contributes to the Black and White Thinking.

Overall, the individual's reaction in this situation can be seen as an example of Black and White Thinking due to their extreme and inflexible response to a complex and nuanced situation.",,no,
Black and White Thinking,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

The situation you've described appears to be an example of black-and-white thinking, also known as dichotomous thinking. This cognitive distortion involves seeing things in only two categories, with no shades of gray or middle ground. In this case, your wife seems to be thinking in terms of ""normal"" (asking immediately) and ""inconsiderate"" (not asking immediately).

It's important to note that both perspectives have some validity. On one hand, asking about her experience right away might make her feel valued and heard. On the other hand, it might not be feasible for you to remember to ask as soon as she gets home, especially if you have children to take care of.

A more flexible approach might be to find a compromise that works for both of you. For example, you could set a specific time to discuss her day, or you could ask her about her experience in a way that feels natural to you, rather than feeling like you have to ask immediately upon her arrival home.

It's also worth considering that your wife's reaction might be influenced by other factors, such as her own expectations or feelings about the special occasion. Open communication and empathy can help you both understand each other's perspectives and find a solution that works for both of you.

In terms of whether an apology is necessary, it might be helpful to apologize for any misunderstanding or hurt feelings, and to express your willingness to find a compromise that works for both of you. This can help repair any damage to your relationship and move forward in a more positive direction.",,no,
Black and White Thinking,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice.

The behavior described in this example demonstrates a form of black and white thinking, also known as dichotomous thinking. This is a cognitive distortion where individuals see things in only two categories, without any shades of gray or middle ground. In this case, the boyfriend seems to be thinking in extremes: either he can perfectly back out of the parking spot, or he can't do it at all, and any attempt to help him is seen as an insult or a sign of his incompetence.

Additionally, the boyfriend's refusal to accept help, even when offered multiple times, and his subsequent outburst and blaming the girlfriend for his frustration, further illustrates black and white thinking. He seems to believe that he should be able to handle everything on his own, and any assistance is a sign of weakness or incompetence.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother.

In this scenario, the mother's behavior is more indicative of **emotional manipulation**, **ingratitude**, and **guilt-tripping** rather than a rigid, dichotomous cognitive distortion. Her statement—*""if I don’t get a Facebook post, I must not mean all that much to you""*—could superficially resemble black-and-white thinking (e.g., ""no post = no love""), but the core issue is her dismissal of the daughter’s extensive efforts and her demand for validation in a specific, narrow form. The mother is **not** framing the entire relationship or her daughter’s actions in absolutist terms (e.g., ""You *never* care about me""); instead, she’s fixating on one unmet expectation and weaponizing it. 

The daughter’s reaction (e.g., calling her mother ""ungrateful"") is a response to perceived unfairness, not an example of black-and-white thinking either. The mother’s pattern of deflection (e.g., playing victim, using tears) further aligns with manipulative tendencies rather than cognitive rigidity.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

In this scenario:  
- The husband is engaging in **verbal abuse** and **generalization** (e.g., calling his wife and others ""incompetent"" over minor mistakes).  
- His behavior reflects **overgeneralization** (assuming incompetence based on isolated incidents) and **emotional abuse** (repeatedly demeaning his partner).  
- The wife is questioning whether his criticisms are fair or abusive, which suggests **self-doubt** rather than black-and-white thinking.

In this scenario, the narrator expresses mixed, complex emotions about their partner's use of AI for a birthday card. They feel sadness and disappointment because the card lacked personal authenticity, but they also recognize that their partner's intention was likely to make them happy. The narrator isn’t framing the situation in absolutes (e.g., ""He never cares about me"" or ""This proves he’s completely lazy""). Instead, they’re grappling with conflicting feelings—appreciating the effort behind the gesture while mourning the loss of genuine personal expression. This is a nuanced, emotionally layered response, not a rigid, binary judgment.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

",0,"The example you provided does **not** clearly exhibit **Black and White Thinking** (also known as all-or-nothing thinking). Black and White Thinking involves viewing situations in extreme, polarized terms—e.g., ""They either love me or hate me,"" ""I'm a total failure or a complete success,"" ""This is perfect or worthless."" 

In your case, you’re expressing frustration and disappointment about the perceived lack of effort in the gifts you received, but your reaction isn’t framed in absolute, dichotomous terms. You acknowledge that you didn’t expect much and that receiving no gifts would have been fine, which shows nuance. Your emotional response (feeling like a fool or the butt of a joke) is more about hurt feelings and perceived disrespect rather than a rigid, all-or-nothing judgment of the situation. 

That said, there is a slight hint of polarized thinking in the way you categorize the gifts as ""zero time/effort"" versus your own thoughtful gifts, but this seems more like a subjective evaluation rather than a rigid cognitive distortion. 

An alternative narrative could be:  
- Your family members may have different gift-giving styles or financial constraints.  
- They might not place the same value on handmade or deeply personal gifts, viewing a Starbucks card as a practical, universally liked option.  
- Their choices don’t necessarily reflect their regard for you; they might simply have different priorities or assumptions about what makes a good gift.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact?

1. **Her Perspective**: Your wife’s expectation—that you ask about her outing immediately—reflects a specific emotional need (e.g., feeling valued or connected) rather than a rigid, absolutist judgment.

2. **Your Perspective**: You acknowledge her request and are willing to try, but you’re also honest about your natural tendencies. This isn’t a refusal framed in extremes (e.g., ""I’ll never remember, so why bother?"").  

3. **Conflict Dynamics**: The disagreement centers on **timing and prioritization**, not a binary moral judgment (e.g., ""You’re either considerate or inconsiderate""). She feels hurt, but her reaction doesn’t inherently dismiss nuance—it’s a call for alignment in emotional responsiveness.  

**Potential Missteps**: If she were to insist that *only* immediate questioning proves love (and anything else is neglect), that *could* edge toward Black and White Thinking. However, based on your description, this seems more like a mismatch in expectations than cognitive distortion.

He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"This scenario does exhibit elements of **Black and White Thinking**, particularly in the way the boyfriend and the narrator frame the situation and their reactions. Here’s how:

1. **Boyfriend's All-or-Nothing Reactions**:  
   - He insists there is ""no way"" to get out of the parking spot, dismissing all possible solutions (e.g., being spotted, asking others to move) as futile. This is a classic example of black-and-white thinking: viewing the situation as either ""completely impossible"" or ""effortlessly easy,"" with no middle ground.  
   - His outburst (throwing items, slamming brakes) and refusal to accept help reflect an inability to tolerate frustration or ambiguity, another hallmark of rigid, polarized thinking.

2. **Narrator's Generalization**:  
   - While the boyfriend’s behavior was unreasonable, the narrator’s concluding statement—*""he always has to find a way to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks""*—frames his actions as an absolute pattern (""always"") with malicious intent (""destroy""). This overlooks nuance (e.g., whether this is a one-time stress reaction or a consistent trend) and assigns a binary motive (""just because it’s not something he picks"").

3. **Mutual Blame Game**:  
   - The boyfriend’s claim that the situation was *entirely* the narrator’s fault (""my fault because I should’ve not spoken to him"") ignores his own role in escalating the conflict, reducing the issue to a single cause. Similarly, the narrator’s focus on him ""ruining the night"" frames the dinner as either ""perfect"" or ""destroyed,"" with no acknowledgment of partial positives (e.g., the enjoyable meal before the incident).

**Black-and-white thinking is present in both parties' interpretations**, though the boyfriend’s behavior is the more extreme example. His refusal to consider alternatives, catastrophic framing (""we’re stuck""), and emotional rigidity align closely with the concept. The narrator’s generalizations also lean toward polarized reasoning, albeit in response to his actions.

Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of Black and White Thinking. First, I need to remember what Black and White Thinking means. From what I know, it's a cognitive distortion where someone views situations in extremes, without considering any middle ground. It's all-or-nothing thinking. Like, if something isn't perfect, it's a total failure, or if someone doesn't do one specific thing, they don't care at all.

Looking at the example, the mother is upset because the daughter didn't make a separate Facebook post just for her. The daughter had already posted a general Mother's Day message and spent the day treating her mom with gifts and activities. The mother's reaction is to say that if there's no personal post, she must not mean much to the daughter. That seems like she's ignoring all the other things the daughter did and focusing solely on the absence of the Facebook post. So she's equating the lack of a specific action (the post) with a total lack of appreciation or love. That does sound like Black and White Thinking because she's reducing the entire day's efforts to one missing element, making it an all-or-nothing scenario.

Also, the daughter's response might have elements of it too. She called her mom ungrateful, perhaps not considering that her mom's feelings (even if unreasonable) are valid in her perspective. But the main issue here is the mother's stance. The mother's statement implies that without the Facebook post, all the other actions are meaningless. That's a classic example of dichotomous thinking where only two options exist: either the daughter does the post (and thus cares) or doesn't (and thus doesn't care), with no middle ground.

Another point is the mother's history of similar behavior, like making rude comments and then playing the victim. This might indicate a pattern of all-or-nothing reactions. The mother's use of emotional manipulation (tears, involving others) when confronted also supports the idea that she's not considering nuances. However, the specific instance in question is the Facebook post demand. 

The father's response about excusing her behavior because of past actions might relate to another cognitive distortion, maybe justification based on past deeds, but that's not directly Black and White Thinking. The core here is the mother's demand and the ultimatum tied to the Facebook post. So yes, the mother's reaction is an example of Black and White Thinking.
</think>

The example provided does involve an instance of Black and White Thinking, specifically from the mother’s perspective. Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, occurs when someone reduces complex situations to binary extremes, ignoring nuance or gradation. In this case, the mother equates the absence of a personalized Facebook post with a lack of love or appreciation, despite the daughter’s extensive efforts to celebrate her throughout the day (e.g., gifts, meals, quality time). By framing the situation as “if you don’t make a separate post, I must not mean much to you,” the mother dismisses all other acts of kindness and reduces the daughter’s care to a single, rigid criterion. This reflects a failure to acknowledge the broader context or the possibility that love can be expressed in multiple ways. 

The mother’s ultimatum exemplifies the cognitive distortion of dichotomous thinking, where outcomes are perceived as either perfect or worthless, with no middle ground. Additionally, her pattern of deflecting criticism (e.g., feigning forgetfulness, using tears to avoid accountability) further underscores a tendency to frame interactions in absolutes, such as portraying herself as a victim while casting others as “mean” or “disrespectful.” While the daughter’s reaction (e.g., labeling her mother “ungrateful”) could also reflect polarized language, the primary instance of Black and White Thinking lies in the mother’s demand and her dismissal of the daughter’s tangible efforts based on one unmet expectation.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example provided is an instance of Black and White Thinking. First, I need to recall what Black and White Thinking is. From what I remember, it's a cognitive distortion where someone views situations in extremes, without recognizing any middle ground. It's also called all-or-nothing thinking. So things are either all good or all bad, with no shades of gray.

Looking at the example given. The husband has been calling the wife incompetent multiple times. He does this after some mistakes she made during the funeral planning and other instances like the car battery and password reset. The wife is questioning if she deserves being called incompetent, considering she handles a lot of responsibilities and is successful at her job.

Now, the husband's behavior: he labels her as incompetent (which is a negative absolute term) based on specific mistakes. Instead of addressing the specific situations, he generalizes her entire capability as incompetent. That seems like Black and White Thinking because he's categorizing her as completely incompetent (black) instead of acknowledging that she might have made some mistakes (which are normal) but is otherwise competent (white). He's not seeing the nuances; he's using absolute terms.

On the other hand, the wife is also considering if she's a ""complete idiot"" despite her accomplishments, which might be her own form of black and white thinking. But the question is about the example being an instance of the concept. The main focus here is the husband's behavior towards her.

So, the husband's actions—using absolute terms like ""incompetent"" repeatedly, especially over varied incidents—fit the Black and White Thinking. He's not considering her overall competence, just focusing on specific errors and labeling her entirely based on those. That's a classic case of all-or-nothing thinking.
</think>

The example provided does indeed illustrate an instance of **Black and White Thinking**, specifically in how the husband categorizes the narrator's actions and character. Black and White Thinking involves viewing situations, people, or behaviors in extreme, polarized terms (e.g., ""competent"" vs. ""incompetent,"" ""good"" vs. ""bad"") without acknowledging nuance or context. Here's how this applies to the scenario:

1. **Husband's Generalized Labeling**: The husband repeatedly calls the narrator ""incompetent"" over isolated incidents (e.g., forgetting a phone number, a typo in a message, needing a password reset). These are minor, situational mistakes common to most people, yet he uses them to assign a sweeping, negative judgment about her overall competence. This ignores her demonstrated capabilities, such as managing household responsibilities for decades, excelling at her job, and mentoring colleagues. By reducing her to ""incompetent,"" he engages in Black and White Thinking, failing to recognize the complexity of her abilities and contributions.

2. **Disregard for Context**: The husband’s criticism lacks acknowledgment of mitigating factors, such as the stress of funeral planning (a high-pressure situation) or the rarity of using the work portal (making a password reset reasonable). Instead, he treats these moments as definitive proof of incompetence, ignoring situational influences—a hallmark of polarized thinking.

3. **Dismissal of Contradictory Evidence**: Despite the narrator’s track record of responsibility (raising three children alone during her husband’s travels, career advancement), the husband fixates on transient errors. This reflects an inability to integrate conflicting information into a balanced assessment, another key feature of Black and White Thinking.

4. **Impact on the Narrator**: The narrator herself begins to internalize this binary framing, questioning whether she is a ""complete idiot"" despite her accomplishments. While her self-reflection shows some nuance, the husband’s persistent use of absolutist language reinforces a harmful, oversimplified narrative.

While the husband’s behavior may stem from grief or stress, his repeated use of absolutist labels (""incompetent"") and failure to contextualize mistakes align with Black and White Thinking. This pattern risks escalating into verbal abuse, as it dismisses the narrator’s humanity and reduces her to a negative stereotype. The question of ""fair criticism vs. verbal abuse"" further underscores the harm of such polarized judgments, as they erode self-worth and ignore multifaceted reality.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"So my partner has always struggled with words and don’t have a way with words. He’s always said he admired my way with words. I studied literature and poetry. I’ve always tried to introduce him to the literature and poetry and tried to find ones I thought he would like. He still struggles but I never mind, I have only showed him those things for his enjoyment not to change him. To me they way is speaks is simply how she speaks. Recently he has discovered chat GBT and uses it to help with some things that need to sound more put together like resumes or letters to a boss (I used to help him with these). However yesterday when I got my birthday card I could tell most of it was ai generated. There was only one bit at the end that included a line that we say to each other that I knew was him. I don’t know how to feel. I’m sad that the card didn’t feel genuine or real. I felt like there was no effort into me. I wouldn’t have minded if it was completely all over the place with no proper grammar if it was from the heart. But it was a long heartfelt whole card long thing that I know was from chat GBT. He wasn’t home to see me open the card and I’m relieved because he was so excited for me to read it and now I feel like it’s because he was hoping I would think he improved but my face would have said it all. AIO. I feel like the reason he used it was to try and make me happy and maybe I should take that and appreciate it at the same time I would’ve preferred something that came from him.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of Black and White Thinking. Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where someone views situations in extremes without considering any middle ground. So, like, seeing things as either perfect or a disaster, with no shades of gray.

In the example, the person is upset because their partner used AI to write a birthday card. They feel sad because the card didn't feel genuine, and they think there was no effort. They mention preferring something heartfelt, even if it's not well-written. But they also acknowledge that their partner probably used AI to make them happy. 

Now, the question is whether this situation involves Black and White Thinking. The person's thoughts: the card is either genuine (from the heart, even with bad grammar) or not genuine (AI-generated, so no effort). Are they seeing it in absolutes? They might be overlooking the possibility that the partner's use of AI was an attempt to express feelings in a way they couldn't on their own. Maybe the partner thought using AI would be better than their own words. But the person here is framing it as either real effort (handwritten) or no effort (AI), without considering that using AI could be a form of effort, just different. 

However, the example also shows some nuance. The person says they feel conflicted—they understand the partner's intention to make them happy but still prefer something from the heart. So maybe they're not entirely in black-and-white because they do see both sides. But the main issue is their emotional reaction, which hinges on the dichotomy between AI-generated (bad) and self-written (good). If they're not allowing for a middle ground where AI-assisted could still have genuine intent, then that's black-and-white thinking. 

But wait, the person's conclusion is that they're torn between appreciating the effort (using AI to make them happy) and wanting something personal. That suggests they can see both aspects, so maybe it's not strictly black-and-white. However, the initial reaction is framing the AI-generated card as not genuine and implying that effort is only valid if it's self-composed. So the thinking here might have elements of black-and-white, but the person is also showing some ability to consider the other perspective. 

Hmm. Black and White Thinking would require the person to be rigidly categorizing the situation into two opposing options without considering other possibilities. In this case, the person is sad because the card wasn't from the heart, but they also recognize the partner's intention. The key is whether their assessment is absolute. They might be thinking that using AI means no effort or genuine feeling, which is an absolute judgment. Alternatively, they might be acknowledging that while the partner tried, the method wasn't to their liking, which is more nuanced. 

The example's main conflict is between valuing authenticity (handwritten) versus the partner's use of a tool (AI). The person's feelings are valid, but the question is about cognitive distortion. If they're viewing the AI-generated card as completely lacking in effort or sincerity (all bad) versus a handwritten one being all good, that's black-and-white. But if they can see that the partner's use of AI was an attempt to make something nice (even if it's not perfect), then maybe not. 

The user's statement: ""I felt like there was no effort into me. I wouldn’t have minded if it was completely all over the place with no proper grammar if it was from the heart. But it was a long heartfelt whole card long thing that I know was from chat GBT."" So they equate AI-generated with no effort and not from the heart. The partner's intention was to make something heartfelt, but using AI invalidates that. So the person is categorizing AI-generated as not genuine, which is an absolute. They don't consider that the partner might have put effort into choosing the AI's output or that the AI was a tool to express genuine feelings. 

In that case, yes, this could be an example of Black and White Thinking because the person is seeing the card as either genuine (handwritten, even messy) or fake (AI-generated, thus no effort), without allowing for the possibility that the partner's use of AI was a genuine attempt to create something meaningful. They're not considering the middle ground where the AI was a medium for the partner's intentions. So the thinking is in absolutes: real vs. fake, effort vs. no effort, based solely on the method used.
</think>

The example provided involves a conflict where the individual feels disappointed that their partner used AI to generate a birthday card, interpreting it as lacking effort and authenticity. To determine if this is an instance of **Black and White Thinking** (a cognitive distortion where situations are viewed in extremes without nuance), we must assess whether the individual rigidly categorizes the situation into absolutes, such as ""genuine vs. fake"" or ""effort vs. no effort,"" without acknowledging potential middle ground.

The individual explicitly contrasts a heartfelt, poorly written card (which they would value) with an AI-generated one (which they perceive as inauthentic). This framing suggests a binary view: self-composed = genuine/effortful, AI-generated = fake/no effort. By dismissing the possibility that the partner’s use of AI could still reflect care (e.g., selecting AI-generated content to articulate feelings they struggle to express), the individual leans toward an all-or-nothing interpretation. They equate the method (AI) with a lack of sincerity, overlooking that the partner’s intent—to create something polished and meaningful—might represent a different form of effort.

However, the individual also demonstrates some nuance by acknowledging the partner’s likely intention to make them happy. This partial recognition of the partner’s perspective complicates the categorization. Yet, the core emotional reaction hinges on the dichotomy between ""authentic"" (self-written) and ""inauthentic"" (AI-assisted), with little room for hybrid possibilities (e.g., AI as a tool to enhance the partner’s limited verbal skills). The emphasis on the card being ""from the heart"" only if self-composed reinforces the binary framework.

Thus, while there is a flicker of acknowledgment about the partner’s motives, the dominant narrative reflects Black and White Thinking. The individual’s disappointment stems from rigidly equating authenticity and effort with the absence of AI, rather than considering how the partner’s actions might blend technology with genuine intent.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.

Okay, so I need to determine if the example given is an instance of Black and White Thinking. Let me start by recalling what Black and White Thinking is. From what I remember, it's a cognitive distortion where a person views situations in extremes, without considering any middle ground. Things are either all good or all bad, with no shades of gray.

Looking at the example, the person describes putting a lot of effort into their gifts—handmade items like stained glass, porcelain bowls, and silver jewelry. They emphasize that it's about the thought, not the price. Then, they receive gifts like a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate basket, which they interpret as zero effort. Their reaction is feeling like a fool, thinking they're the butt of a joke, and leaving the event upset.

So, the key here is whether the person is seeing the situation in absolutes. They received gifts they deemed low-effort, which made them feel unappreciated. But Black and White Thinking would involve interpreting the situation in extremes. For example, thinking that because the gifts weren't thoughtful, the family members don't care at all. Or that the situation is entirely negative with no possible other explanations.

The person mentions feeling like a fool and that they were being laughed at. They might be assuming the worst possible intent from their family members. Are they considering other possibilities? Like maybe the family members have different ways of showing appreciation, or perhaps they were busy and thought a gift card was practical. The original poster seems to jump to the conclusion that the gifts mean zero effort and that they're being mocked, which might be an overgeneralization.

Another angle: the person's expectations. They say they didn't expect much and would be fine with no gifts, but receiving these specific gifts made them feel worse. The reaction is a strong negative emotion, which might stem from seeing the situation as entirely negative (their effort vs. others' lack) without considering middle ground. For example, maybe the family members did put some thought but in a different way, or maybe they have different capacities for gift-giving.

But wait, the person is open to alternative narratives, which suggests they might not be rigidly stuck in their view. However, their initial reaction is framed in absolute terms: the gifts are ""zero time/effort,"" leading to feeling like a fool. That does sound like Black and White Thinking because they're categorizing the gifts as completely thoughtless, and their own as completely thoughtful, without allowing for any in-between. They might not be considering that the family members' intentions could be neutral or even positive, just expressed differently.

So, yes, this seems to fit. The person is interpreting the situation in extremes (their effort vs. others' no effort) and drawing a conclusion that leads to emotional distress, which is characteristic of Black and White Thinking.
</think>

The example provided does exhibit elements of **Black and White Thinking**, a cognitive distortion where situations are viewed in absolute, polarized terms (e.g., ""all good"" vs. ""all bad"") without acknowledging nuances or middle ground. Here's why:

1. **Extreme Interpretation of Effort**: The narrator categorizes their own gifts as deeply thoughtful and effortful (e.g., handmade items) while dismissing the family’s gifts (Starbucks gift card, hot chocolate basket) as inherently ""zero time/effort."" This binary framing assumes that the family’s gifts *must* reflect total apathy, without considering alternative explanations (e.g., differing gift-giving styles, financial constraints, time limitations, or even the possibility that some recipients might genuinely enjoy practical or consumable items).

2. **Assumption of Malicious Intent**: The narrator concludes that they were ""the butt of some joke"" or being ""laughed at,"" interpreting the situation in extremes (either intentional mockery or complete disregard). This overlooks neutral or benign possibilities, such as the family members not sharing the same values around gift-giving or simply prioritizing convenience over craftsmanship.

3. **Emotional Polarization**: The emotional response—feeling like a ""complete fool"" and leaving the event—stems from viewing the situation as entirely negative, with no room for balanced perspectives (e.g., ""Some gifts were less personal, but others might still appreciate my efforts""). The absence of moderating thoughts reinforces the all-or-nothing framework.

### Alternative Narratives to Counter Black and White Thinking:
- **Different Priorities**: Family members might value practicality or assume others prefer generic gifts to avoid imposing personal tastes. A gift card could reflect a desire to let the recipient choose their own experience.
- **Capacity Differences**: Not everyone has the time, skill, or resources to create handmade items. A gift card might represent their best effort under constraints.
- **Misaligned Expectations**: The narrator’s emphasis on thoughtfulness might not be universally shared. The family may not realize how much weight the narrator places on personalized gifts.
- **Positive Intentions**: The gifts, while impersonal, might still reflect a desire to participate in the tradition or show care in their own way.

By reframing the situation to include these possibilities, the narrator could reduce the emotional intensity and avoid the pitfalls of Black and White Thinking.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example provided is an instance of Black and White Thinking. Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where someone views situations in extremes without considering any middle ground. Things are either all good or all bad, with no shades of gray.

Looking at the scenario: The person's mom threw away their sentimental teddy bear. The individual reacted very strongly, leading to a family conflict. The user is asking if their reaction (yelling, slamming doors, etc.) was an overreaction and if they're the asshole. But the specific question here is whether this situation exemplifies Black and White Thinking.

First, I need to check if the thinking in the example shows a lack of nuance. The mother's action is seen as entirely wrong, but maybe the daughter is viewing her mother's actions as completely inconsiderate without considering possible reasons (though the mom's past actions do show a pattern). However, the daughter's reaction is emotional but perhaps justified given the sentimental value. The family's reaction is that she overreacted. 

But where does Black and White Thinking come into play here? Let's see the daughter's perspective. She might be thinking in absolutes like ""My mom is terrible for doing this"" without considering any possible middle ground, like maybe the mom thought the bear was damaged beyond repair or had a different reason. However, the daughter's post explains that the mom's reasoning was about age (""too old for stuffed animals""), which the daughter sees as invalid. The daughter's reaction is intense, but does that indicate Black and White Thinking? Or is it just an emotional response?

Alternatively, maybe the mother is engaging in Black and White Thinking by believing that once someone is an adult, they shouldn't have stuffed animals, which is an absolute statement. The mom's action is based on the belief that there's no middle ground (either you're a child with stuffed animals or an adult without). That would be an example of Black and White Thinking. However, the question is about the example as a whole being an instance of the concept, not necessarily the characters within it. The example itself is a scenario where the mother's reasoning might be based on all-or-nothing logic. But the user's question is whether the scenario presented is an instance of Black and White Thinking. 

Wait, the user is asking if the example (the entire AITA post) is an instance of Black and White Thinking. So we need to look at how the person (the OP) is thinking. The OP is conflicted about whether they overreacted. They're considering if their extreme reaction (causing a scene) was justified. But are they thinking in black and white terms? For example, are they framing the situation as ""either I'm completely right and my mom is completely wrong"" or ""I'm a terrible person for reacting that way""? The OP does question if they overreacted, showing they are considering the possibility that their actions might have been too much. However, they also defend their attachment to the bear. But the key here is whether the OP's reasoning or the scenario itself demonstrates Black and White Thinking.

The mother's action of throwing away the bear because OP is ""too old"" is an example of Black and White Thinking. The mother sees having a stuffed animal as only appropriate for children, not adults. That's a binary categorization. However, the question is about the example (the entire situation) being an instance of the concept. Since the mother's reasoning is based on an all-or-nothing perspective, the scenario does involve Black and White Thinking. Alternatively, the OP's reaction (if they see their mom as entirely in the wrong and themselves as entirely right) could also be an example. But the OP is actually questioning their own reaction, showing they are considering the middle ground. The mother's reasoning is more aligned with Black and White Thinking here.
</think>

The scenario described in the post involves **Black and White Thinking**, primarily exhibited by the mother. Her decision to throw away the teddy bear is rooted in the belief that adults should not own stuffed animals, a rigid, all-or-nothing perspective that dismisses nuance (e.g., sentimental value, emotional attachment). This reflects the core of Black and White Thinking: categorizing situations into absolutes (e.g., ""children have toys, adults do not"") without acknowledging exceptions or context. 

The mother’s prior action of discarding the red jacket similarly illustrates this pattern, as she imposed her own judgment about what is ""appropriate"" to keep, ignoring the emotional significance of the items. Her reasoning lacks consideration for the middle ground, such as discussing the item’s condition or finding compromises (e.g., storage solutions). 

The daughter’s reaction, while emotional, does not clearly demonstrate Black and White Thinking. She questions whether her response was excessive, showing self-reflection and openness to nuance. Her anger stems from repeated disregard for her feelings, not a rigid binary worldview. The family’s polarized reactions (e.g., grounding her, labeling her behavior a ""tantrum"") might also reflect absolutist judgments, but the central instance of Black and White Thinking lies in the mother’s rationale for discarding the bear.

I told her that i’d try harder but that it’s hard for me to program myself to remember to ask as soon as she gets home. She told me that I shouldn’t have to try and that it’s “normal” to just ask. She feels like I’m inconsiderate.

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the example given is an instance of Black and White Thinking. Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where someone views situations in extremes, without considering any middle ground. So, like, things are either all good or all bad, with no shades of gray.

In the example, the husband's wife gets upset because he doesn't immediately ask her how her special event went when she gets home. He eventually asks later, but she feels he's inconsiderate for not doing it right away. She says he shouldn't have to try and that it's ""normal"" to ask immediately. The husband is confused and wonders if he should apologize.

So, does the wife's reaction fit Black and White Thinking? Let's break it down. She seems to think that if he doesn't ask immediately, it's inconsiderate. She's framing his actions as either considerate (by asking right away) or inconsiderate (any delay). But there's a middle ground here. Maybe he's not being inconsiderate but just has a different way of processing or timing. She's not considering that his eventual asking could still be caring, just delayed. She's setting up a binary: either he does it immediately (good) or he's inconsiderate (bad). That fits the definition of Black and White Thinking because she's not allowing for other possibilities or reasons for his behavior. 

Additionally, she says he ""shouldn't have to try,"" implying that if he really cared, it would come naturally. That's another binary: either it's effortless (good) or forced (bad). But people have different habits and ways of showing care. He's making an effort, which she dismisses because it's not automatic. That's another all-or-nothing perspective.

However, I should check if there's another angle. Maybe she's just expressing a need for immediate connection, and her frustration is more about feeling valued. But the way she frames it as ""normal"" and labels him inconsiderate for not meeting that expectation suggests she's seeing it in absolutes. If she acknowledged that his delay doesn't mean he doesn't care but still prefers the immediate response, that wouldn't be Black and White. But her stance seems more rigid here.
</think>

The example provided does exhibit elements of Black and White Thinking, primarily in how the wife frames the situation. Black and White Thinking involves viewing issues in absolutes, such as ""right vs. wrong"" or ""normal vs. abnormal,"" without acknowledging nuance or middle ground. Here, the wife equates the husband’s delayed inquiry about her event with being ""inconsiderate,"" implying that his actions are either fully considerate (asking immediately) or entirely inconsiderate (any delay). She also dismisses his effort to improve by asserting that he ""shouldn’t have to try,"" framing genuine care as something that must be instinctive rather than learned or intentional. This overlooks the possibility that his eventual inquiry could still reflect care, even if delayed, and that effort itself is a valid form of consideration. Her focus on ""normal"" behavior further reinforces a binary view of what is acceptable, leaving no room for differences in communication styles or timing. While her desire for connection is valid, her rigid interpretation of his actions aligns with the cognitive distortion of Black and White Thinking.

Black and White Thinking,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example provided is an instance of Black and White Thinking. First, I need to recall what Black and White Thinking means. Oh right, it's a cognitive distortion where someone views situations in extremes, like all good or all bad, without considering the middle ground. Also known as all-or-nothing thinking.

Looking at the example: The couple had a nice dinner, then there was a parking issue. The boyfriend couldn't get out of the spot, refused help, got angry, and the situation escalated. Later, the girlfriend says he ruined the night and accuses him of always destroying dates she plans. The boyfriend blames her entirely, saying she shouldn't have spoken.

So, the key points here are the girlfriend's statement that he ""always has to find a way to destroy any date or thing"" she wants to do. That's a generalization using absolute terms like ""always,"" which is a sign of black-and-white thinking. She's not considering that maybe there are times when he doesn't do this, framing his behavior as all bad. Similarly, the boyfriend blames her entirely, not acknowledging any middle ground in their interaction—another possible instance.

Wait, but the question is whether the example itself is an instance of Black and White Thinking. The scenario includes the boyfriend's reaction and the girlfriend's accusation. So, both of their statements might exhibit this thinking. The girlfriend's accusation uses absolute terms (""always""), which is classic black-and-white. The boyfriend's refusal to accept help and his blaming her entirely (saying it's her fault) could also be seen as black-and-white, as he's not considering other factors or shared responsibility.

So the example includes instances of Black and White Thinking from both parties. Therefore, the answer would be yes. The presence of absolute statements and polarized viewpoints (either all her fault or him always ruining things) fits the definition.
</think>

The example provided contains elements of **Black and White Thinking** (also called all-or-nothing thinking), primarily in how the girlfriend and boyfriend frame their perspectives and accusations. This cognitive distortion involves viewing situations in extremes (e.g., ""always/never,"" ""perfect/ruined"") without acknowledging nuance or middle ground. Here’s how it manifests in the scenario:

1. **The Girlfriend’s Accusation**:  
   When she tells her boyfriend, *""he always has to find a way to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks,""* she uses absolutist language (""always"") to generalize his behavior. This ignores potential exceptions or complexities, framing his actions as universally negative and intentional. She reduces their entire history of interactions to a binary pattern: he either ruins her plans or doesn’t, with no room for variability or context.

2. **The Boyfriend’s Blame**:  
   He claims the situation is *""my fault because I should’ve not spoken to him,""* assigning total responsibility to her while dismissing his own role in escalating the conflict (e.g., refusing help, emotional outbursts). This reflects black-and-white reasoning by positioning her as the sole cause of the problem, rather than acknowledging shared dynamics or his own contributions.

3. **Polarized Outcomes**:  
   The girlfriend describes the initially ""perfect"" dinner as being ""ruined"" entirely by his actions, framing the evening as either flawless or destroyed. Similarly, the boyfriend insists there was ""no way we were getting out of the spot,"" rejecting incremental solutions (e.g., her spotting him) until forced to concede. Both exhibit a tendency to view the situation in absolute terms (success vs. failure, perfect vs. ruined) rather than recognizing partial successes or mixed emotions.

### Why This Fits Black and White Thinking:  
The core issue lies in the rigid, extreme framing of events and behaviors. The girlfriend’s use of ""always"" and the boyfriend’s total blame are textbook examples of this cognitive distortion. Additionally, their inability to resolve the conflict collaboratively—due to polarized stances—highlights how black-and-white thinking can escalate disagreements by shutting down compromise or shared problem-solving.

Black and White Thinking,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"The example provided does not directly illustrate Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking. Black and White Thinking is a cognitive distortion where situations are viewed in absolute terms, with no middle ground. For example, a person might believe that they are either a complete success or a total failure, with no possibility of being somewhere in between.

In the scenario described, the mother appears to be focused on the absence of a specific action (a personal Facebook post) as a measure of her daughter's love and appreciation, despite the numerous other actions the daughter took to honor her on Mother's Day. This focus on a single aspect and the emotional response it triggers could be seen as an example of an all-or-nothing mindset, but it is more reflective of a specific emotional response rather than a broader pattern of Black and White Thinking.

The daughter's reaction, labeling her mother as ungrateful and deciding on a ""time out"" period, could also be seen as an emotional response rather than an example of Black and White Thinking. The daughter's actions suggest she feels undervalued by her mother's response, leading to a strong reaction.

Both the mother and daughter's responses might be better described as examples of emotional reasoning or overgeneralization, where one event is taken as a sign of a broader pattern of behavior or attitude.

Therefore, while the scenario touches on aspects that could be related to Black and White Thinking, it does not clearly demonstrate the concept as a whole.

Black and White Thinking,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"The example you've provided does not directly illustrate the concept of Black and White Thinking, also known as All-or-Nothing Thinking. Black and White Thinking is a cognitive distortion where a person views situations in absolute terms, such as good or bad, right or wrong, with no middle ground. It involves an inability to see shades of gray or consider nuanced perspectives.

In your example, your husband's behavior seems more indicative of verbal abuse rather than Black and White Thinking. He is using harsh language and criticism to express his frustration, which is abusive behavior. This does not necessarily mean he is viewing you or situations in absolute terms without any nuance; rather, he is expressing his anger in a harmful way.

While it's important to address and work on any issues that may be causing stress and conflict in your relationship, it's equally important to recognize and address abusive behavior. If you feel that the criticism is unwarranted and harmful, it may be beneficial to seek support from a counselor or therapist who can help you navigate these complex issues.

Black and White Thinking,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

",0,"The example provided does not appear to be an instance of Black and White Thinking. Black and White Thinking, also known as All-or-Nothing Thinking, is a cognitive distortion where individuals see things in extremes, such as completely good or completely bad, with no middle ground. This type of thinking often leads to harsh judgments and a lack of nuance in understanding situations.

In the scenario described, the individual expresses disappointment and frustration with the gifts received from family members, feeling that they did not match the effort and thought put into the gifts he gave. However, this response does not necessarily indicate an absence of a middle ground or an extreme view of the situation. Instead, it reflects a genuine emotional response to feeling undervalued or underappreciated.

The individual acknowledges that he enjoys giving gifts and that receiving gifts is not a quid pro quo situation. He also mentions that he did not expect much in return and would have been fine with receiving no gifts at all. This suggests that his expectations were not rigidly fixed on receiving gifts of equal value or effort, which is a characteristic of Black and White Thinking.

Furthermore, the individual's reaction is a nuanced emotional response rather than an absolute judgment of the situation. He feels like a fool and is hurt by the perceived lack of effort from his family members, but he does not state that the gifts are entirely worthless or that his family members are entirely to blame. Instead, he seeks an alternative narrative to help him process his feelings, indicating a willingness to consider different perspectives.

Black and White Thinking,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact?

This type of thinking often involves seeing things as either completely good or completely bad, with no room for nuance or complexity.

In the scenario you've described, the individual is grappling with a situation where their mother threw away a sentimental teddy bear, leading to a significant emotional reaction. The individual expresses feelings of anger and frustration, and there is a clear sense of conflict within the family. While the individual's reaction might be seen as intense, the scenario does not necessarily demonstrate Black and White Thinking. Instead, it appears to be a case of strong emotional attachment to a sentimental object and a resulting emotional response to its loss.

The individual acknowledges the sentimental value of the teddy bear and expresses feelings of betrayal and hurt due to its disposal. This reaction is understandable given the sentimental value attached to the bear. The family's response, which includes grounding and taking away privileges, further complicates the situation and may contribute to the individual's feelings of being misunderstood.

In summary, the scenario does not clearly illustrate Black and White Thinking, as the individual's reaction is more about emotional attachment and the loss of a valued object rather than an extreme, polarized view of the situation. The individual is seeking validation for their feelings and questioning whether their reaction was appropriate, which suggests a recognition of the complexity of the situation rather than an all-or-nothing perspective.

Black and White Thinking,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"Black and White Thinking, also known as All-or-Nothing Thinking, is a cognitive distortion where individuals perceive situations in extremes, often seeing things as either completely good or completely bad, with no middle ground. This type of thinking can lead to rigid and inflexible perspectives, where compromise or understanding alternative viewpoints is difficult.

In the scenario you've described, your wife seems to be expecting a specific behavior from you—asking her about her night as soon as she gets home—and views any deviation from this expectation as inconsiderate. This expectation may be rooted in her own experiences or beliefs about what is ""normal"" behavior in a relationship. If she is unable to acknowledge that there might be different ways of showing interest or care, and insists that her way is the only ""normal"" or acceptable way, it could be indicative of Black and White Thinking.

However, it's important to note that this interpretation depends on the context and the entirety of her behavior and communication. If she is open to discussing her feelings and willing to understand your perspective, it may not be a case of Black and White Thinking but rather a misunderstanding or a difference in communication styles.

In terms of whether you should apologize, it depends on your intentions and the impact of your actions on your wife. If your intention is to show interest and care but you simply forget to ask right away, and this oversight causes her to feel unappreciated or unloved, then an apology might be a way to show empathy and understanding of her feelings. It doesn't necessarily mean you are in the wrong, but acknowledging her feelings can be a part of maintaining a healthy relationship.

In summary, the situation could potentially be an instance of Black and White Thinking, especially if your wife is inflexible in her expectations and sees your behavior as either completely considerate or completely inconsiderate with no room for nuance. However, further context and communication between you and your wife would be necessary to make a definitive assessment.

",0,"The concept of the Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to a situation where an individual continues to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This fallacy leads people to prioritize their past investments over their current well-being or future prospects.

In the given scenario, the woman is describing a marriage that has become unfulfilling and unevenly distributed in terms of responsibilities and emotional connection. She has been shouldering the bulk of the financial and household responsibilities, while her husband contributes minimally and prioritizes his leisure activities. The lack of intimacy and emotional connection has also taken a toll on her self-esteem and desire for physical affection.

The woman's dilemma about whether to stay in the marriage or leave can be analyzed through the lens of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. She has invested six years of her life into this relationship, including almost four years of marriage. The fear of the unknown and the potential consequences of leaving the marriage are holding her back from making a decision.

In this context, the Sunk Cost Fallacy might be at play if the woman is staying in the marriage primarily because of the time and emotional investment she has already made, rather than because the relationship is currently meeting her needs or making her happy. She may be thinking that since she has already invested so much, she should continue to try to make it work, even if it means sacrificing her own well-being and happiness.

However, it's essential to recognize that the Sunk Cost Fallacy is not the only factor at play here. The woman's fear of the unknown, her financial dependence on her current situation, and her emotional attachment to her husband are all complex factors that influence her decision-making process.

Ultimately, the woman's situation is a nuanced and multifaceted one, and it's difficult to pinpoint a single reason for her hesitation to leave the marriage. While the Sunk Cost Fallacy may be a contributing factor, it's not the only consideration at play.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The scenario described involves a boyfriend going on an hour-long rant about Rachel Zegler, criticizing her for various reasons such as her facial expressions, confidence, and opinions. The girlfriend feels that the boyfriend's reaction is not about Rachel Zegler, but rather about his discomfort with confident, expressive, and outspoken women.

To determine if this is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, let's first define the concept. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when someone continues to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This fallacy is often seen in situations where someone is trying to justify a past decision or investment.

In this scenario, there is no apparent investment or commitment that the boyfriend has made, which he is trying to justify or recover. His rant about Rachel Zegler seems to be driven by his personal opinions and biases, rather than a desire to justify a past decision or investment.

The girlfriend's analysis of the situation suggests that the boyfriend's reaction is rooted in his discomfort with feminist ideals and confident women, rather than any rational criticism of Rachel Zegler. The boyfriend's attempt to tell the girlfriend that she doesn't actually like Rachel Zegler, but is only defending her because of her feminist views, is a form of gaslighting and an attempt to control the girlfriend's opinions.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy is not relevant to this scenario, as there is no apparent investment or commitment that the boyfriend is trying to justify. Instead, the scenario appears to be an example of patriarchal bias, misogyny, and an attempt to control and manipulate the girlfriend's opinions.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"The concept of Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to the tendency to continue investing in a decision or situation because of the resources (time, money, effort) already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. In this scenario, the individual is feeling devastated because her fiancé is suggesting postponing the wedding due to some concerns he has about the venue. The fiancé's concerns seem to be focused on the amenities and services provided by the venue, such as the lack of toilets and the sound system.

The individual, on the other hand, is more concerned about the fact that they have already invested a significant amount of time, money, and effort into planning the wedding. She mentions that they have already paid a deposit, invited guests, hired a photographer, and made other arrangements. She feels that it's too late to stop now because of all the resources they have already committed.

In this case, the individual's reluctance to consider postponing the wedding or changing the venue can be seen as an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. She is allowing the resources they have already invested to influence her decision, rather than considering whether the current venue is truly the best choice for their wedding. She is essentially saying that they should continue with the current plan because of the sunk costs, rather than evaluating the situation objectively and considering alternative options.

It's worth noting that the individual's fiancé is not necessarily exhibiting the Sunk Cost Fallacy. He is expressing concerns about the venue and suggesting that they consider alternative options, which is a rational and objective evaluation of the situation. His concerns are focused on the quality of the venue and the services provided, rather than the resources they have already invested.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"The situation described involves a person feeling disappointed and crestfallen because their husband hasn't tried a piece of the Tres Leches cake they made for his friends, despite putting in effort to prepare it. The husband's lack of interest in the cake, combined with his consumption of other baked goods, has led to the person's feelings of disappointment.

To determine if this is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, let's first define the concept. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals continue to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This fallacy leads people to prioritize their past investments over their current well-being or future benefits.

In this scenario, the person has already invested time and effort into making the Tres Leches cake. They are now feeling disappointed because their husband hasn't tried it, and they are offering it to him repeatedly. The question is whether the person's desire for their husband to try the cake is driven by a desire to recoup their investment (i.e., the time and effort spent making the cake) or if it's driven by other factors, such as a desire for appreciation or validation.

While the person's feelings of disappointment and crestfallenness are understandable, their desire for their husband to try the cake doesn't necessarily seem to be driven by a desire to recoup their investment. Instead, it appears to be driven by a desire for appreciation and validation of their efforts. The person has already stated that they don't expect their husband to eat every piece, but they do want him to try some, which suggests that their motivation is not solely driven by a desire to avoid ""wasting"" the cake.

Furthermore, the person's husband has apologized and explained that he hasn't been hungry, which suggests that his lack of interest in the cake is not a rejection of the person's efforts, but rather a matter of personal preference. The person's feelings of disappointment and crestfallenness seem to be driven by a sense of unappreciation and misunderstanding, rather than a desire to justify their past investment.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it doesn't appear that the person's behavior is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The person's desire for their husband to try the cake seems to be driven by a desire for appreciation and validation, rather than a desire to recoup their investment.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"The concept of Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to a situation where an individual continues to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This fallacy leads people to make irrational decisions based on past investments rather than current circumstances.

In the given scenario, the narrator initially agrees to take a 15-minute break from work to help his wife with her car, which has a low tire. However, the situation escalates when the tire cannot be inflated at Discount Tire, and the narrator is faced with a half-hour wait for repairs. His wife wants him to stay and wait, but he needs to return to work.

The narrator's decision to leave Discount Tire and return home, despite his wife's wishes, is not an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Instead, he is making a rational decision based on his current circumstances, which is the need to return to work. He has already invested 15 minutes into helping his wife, but continuing to wait for an hour or more would require him to sacrifice more time and potentially impact his work.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy would apply if the narrator decided to stay and wait for the repairs solely because he had already invested 15 minutes into the task, even if it no longer made sense to do so given his work commitments. However, in this case, the narrator is prioritizing his work obligations and making a decision based on his current situation, rather than being influenced by the time he has already invested.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"The scenario you've described involves a situation where you had initially agreed to contribute to a group event, but later discovered that the planned menu would not accommodate your dietary restrictions and allergies. After deciding not to attend due to this issue, you requested a refund of your contribution. The reaction from your friend H and her friends was negative, with them accusing you of being petty and suggesting that your withdrawal would harm their budget.

The concept of the Sunk Cost Fallacy is relevant here. The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when individuals continue to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. In your case, H and her friends are arguing that you should not back out because your contribution is already part of their budget, implying that withdrawing your participation would waste the money you've already put in.

However, from your perspective, the decision to back out is based on new information (the menu not accommodating your dietary needs) that significantly affects your ability to participate fully and safely in the event. Your request for a refund is a rational response to this new information, rather than an emotional or petty reaction.

The key point here is that the money you contributed was based on certain expectations about the event, which were not met. Your decision to withdraw and request a refund is not about being petty or causing harm to others, but about making a sensible choice given the circumstances.

H and her friends are falling into the Sunk Cost Fallacy by implying that you should continue with your commitment simply because you've already paid, regardless of whether the event now meets your needs or not. They are prioritizing the group's budget over your legitimate concerns about your dietary restrictions, which is not a reasonable expectation.

Therefore, your decision to back out and request a refund, given the change in circumstances (the menu not accommodating your needs), is a rational choice and not an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Instead, it's H and her friends who are exhibiting behavior consistent with the Sunk Cost Fallacy by pressuring you to stay committed due to the sunk cost (your initial contribution), despite the new information that makes your participation less desirable or even unsafe for you.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"The scenario you've described involves a complex interaction between you and your cousin, with underlying themes of perceived intelligence, academic achievement, and personal validation. To determine if this is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, let's first define what the Sunk Cost Fallacy is. The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when someone continues to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This fallacy is about decision-making being influenced by past investments, rather than considering the current situation and future outcomes.

In your story, the Sunk Cost Fallacy does not directly apply to your interaction with your cousin regarding her intelligence or academic achievements. The fallacy typically relates to decisions about whether to continue or abandon a project, investment, or endeavor based on the resources already sunk into it, not to personal opinions or ego-related discussions.

Your conversation with your cousin seems more about ego, perceived intelligence, and the need for validation. Your cousin's behavior could be seen as seeking validation for her academic achievements and feeling threatened when you didn't provide the acknowledgement she expected. Your response pointed out the inconsistency in her claiming to be secure in her intelligence while still needing your validation.

The closest connection to the concept of sunk costs in this scenario might be if one were to interpret your cousin's years of study and effort to obtain her PhD as a ""sunk cost"" that she feels needs to be recognized or validated by others to justify her investment. However, this is a bit of a stretch from the traditional definition of sunk costs in economic or decision-making contexts.

Therefore, considering the traditional definition and application of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, this scenario does not directly exemplify the concept.

",0,"To determine if this scenario is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, let's first define what the Sunk Cost Fallacy is. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual continues to invest time, money, or effort into something because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This fallacy leads people to ""throw good money after bad"" or continue down a path because of the sunk costs, rather than making decisions based on the current situation and future potential.

In the given scenario, the context provided doesn't directly relate to the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The situation describes a conflict within a family setting, specifically involving the narrator, her father, and her boyfriend. The conflict arises from the father's criticism of the narrator for being ""disgusting and dirty"" due to a few drops of water on the floor, which escalates into a more personal attack on her character. The narrator's response is to clean the floor quietly and then retreat to her room, feeling upset.

The question of whether the narrator was an ""asshole,"" ""childish,"" or if she should have stayed, pertains more to interpersonal dynamics, emotional responses, and conflict resolution strategies rather than the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy would be relevant if the discussion involved continuing an investment or a course of action (like staying in a relationship or continuing a project) solely because of the resources already invested, despite it no longer being beneficial or desirable.

Given the information provided, the scenario does not illustrate a decision-making process influenced by the desire to recoup sunk costs or investments. Instead, it highlights a family conflict and the emotional aftermath of verbal abuse. Therefore, the scenario does not exemplify the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,gpt-4o,"My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband?

All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore.

I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

",0,"The scenario described involves a woman contemplating whether to stay in her marriage despite feeling unfulfilled and burdened by unequal responsibilities. The concept of the Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to the tendency of individuals to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even when continued involvement is not the best course of action.

In this situation, the woman's decision to stay in the marriage may partially be influenced by the time and effort she has already invested (6 years in the relationship and nearly 4 years in marriage), even when the current situation is dissatisfying and seems unlikely to improve. Her fear of the unknown aspects of leaving also contributes to her hesitation.

Therefore, the hesitation to leave based on past investment and fear of starting over matches the concept of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as she might be allowing her previous investment in the relationship to overshadow a rational evaluation of her current happiness and future prospects.

The sunk cost fallacy typically involves making decisions based on the time, effort, or money already spent, rather than on the current or future value or benefits. For instance, continuing to watch a movie you aren't enjoying just because you've already watched half of it would be an example of the sunk cost fallacy.

In the scenario you presented, the boyfriend is expressing his strong opinions about Rachel Zegler and feminism, and this is causing tension in the relationship. The girlfriend feels drained and questions the motives behind her boyfriend's critique. This scenario is about social dynamics, personal beliefs, and communication within a relationship, rather than being influenced by irrecoverable costs or investments made in the past.

Therefore, this situation does not pertain to the sunk cost fallacy, as it does not involve decisions influenced by past expenditures.

The narrator feels devastated at the idea of postponing because they have already put significant effort and resources into planning the wedding — invitations have been sent, a suit has been purchased, a photographer has been hired, etc. This indicates that the narrator may be experiencing the Sunk Cost Fallacy. They feel committed to the current plan mainly due to the time and money already invested, rather than objectively considering whether addressing the fiancé's concerns might lead to a better overall wedding experience.

While the fiancé is attempting to revisit the decision based on new information and a desire to ensure the quality of their wedding day, the narrator is more focused on the resources already expended, indicating a classic case of the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

In this scenario, the issue seems to be more about communication and interpersonal expectations rather than a decision-making process influenced by past investments.

The person made a cake and seems to be seeking validation or appreciation for their effort, which their husband has not provided by not trying the cake. The husband's actions, or lack thereof, are causing emotional distress to the person who made the cake. This situation might be more related to relationship dynamics, communication, or emotional expectations rather than the sunk cost fallacy.

The sunk cost fallacy would apply if, for example, the person kept making cakes that were not eaten or enjoyed, but they continued doing so because they had already invested so much time and effort into the process. However, the narrative provided does not present such a context.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,gpt-4o,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"In order to determine if the scenario presented is an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, let's first define what the Sunk Cost Fallacy is. The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when individuals continue an endeavor or continue consuming or pursuing an option based solely on the cumulative prior investment (time, money, resources) despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, moving forward, of continuing the endeavor outweighs the expected benefit. Essentially, it's the reasoning that the resources already invested justify further investment, even if it doesn't make rational sense.

In the scenario listed, you initially agreed to a 15-minute favor to help your wife by taking her car to the shop for a quick tire check. However, upon discovering that more extensive work was needed, extending your commitment far beyond what you initially agreed to, you faced a choice: stay and wait at Discount Tire, impacting your work and schedule, or return home and have your wife handle the situation or reschedule.

You chose to return home, prioritizing your work obligations over extending your time investment at Discount Tire. Your decision was based on the practical reality of the situation: your work constraints and the fact that the tire was not dangerously flat, allowing you to return home safely.

This situation does not reflect a continuation of the endeavor based on prior investment but rather an evaluation of current priorities and constraints. You decided not to further invest your time, as the additional cost (time away from work) was not justified by the circumstances.

Therefore, the decision to back out of the favor when it extended beyond the initial time expected does not exhibit the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as you did not continue the endeavor simply because you had already committed a certain amount of time. Instead, you re-evaluated the situation based on new information and made a decision that prioritized your immediate obligations.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,gpt-4o,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"To determine if this is an instance of the sunk cost fallacy, we need to understand what the fallacy entails. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues with a course of action due to previously invested resources (such as time, money, or effort), even when it's clear that the current path is not the best option. In essence, it's the mistaken belief that one must continue investing in something because they've already put resources into it, rather than considering what will yield the best overall outcome moving forward.

In this situation, you decided not to attend the event after realizing that the arrangements were not suitable for your dietary restrictions and after finding that your concerns about the menu were not addressed. The disagreement arose when you requested a refund of your contribution, which had already been made based on the understanding that you would be attending an event that catered to all attendees' needs.

The sunk cost fallacy would suggest that you should attend the event simply because you've already contributed financially, even though attending would not be in your best interest due to your allergies and food restrictions not being accommodated. However, in this case, you are attempting to withdraw the sunk cost (your financial contribution) and make a decision (not to attend) based on the present situation rather than feeling obligated to go simply because you have already paid.

Therefore, this example is not an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. Instead, you are seeking to recover your resources and make a decision based on the current benefits and drawbacks, rather than irrationally sticking with the decision to attend because of past investment.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,gpt-4o,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA?

It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes.

The focus is on the *past* investment influencing a *current* decision.

In this case, the woman is contemplating leaving her marriage but is hesitant because of the time (6 years) she has already invested. She explicitly states she is ""scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap,"" implying that the years spent together contribute to this fear.

While other factors are surely at play (e.g., social expectations, fear of being alone, financial concerns), the sunk cost fallacy seems to be influencing her decision-making process. The thought process is likely, ""I've put so much time into this marriage; I can't just throw it all away."" It's worth noting, that if she were to realize that she would be better off financially, emotionally, and have a better quality of life after divorcing, then staying in this marriage purely because of the time she has invested is the sunk cost fallacy.

Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"This scenario does not perfectly illustrate the sunk cost fallacy, but it has elements that are related. The sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues to invest resources (time, money, effort) into a failing endeavor because they have already invested resources in it, even if a rational analysis would suggest abandoning the endeavor.

Here's why it's not a *pure* example:

*   **The husband hadn't invested a significant amount of *irrevocable* resources yet.** He spent a relatively short amount of time driving the car initially. The issue is more about the *potential* investment of time than an investment already made.
*   **The wife's upset may stem from a perceived lack of support and fairness**, rather than a pure cognitive bias related to sunk costs. She may be thinking, ""I've worked all day, he should be willing to do this favor for me.""

Here's where elements related to sunk costs might be creeping in:

*   **The initial ""15-minute favor"" framing:** The wife may be mentally anchoring on the initial small time commitment, making her reluctant to abandon the task even when the situation changed. However, this is more related to commitment bias rather than sunk cost.

In short, the story highlights the interpersonal conflict and the wife's strong desire for her husband to follow through, likely rooted in a desire for support and perhaps some anchoring on the initial low-effort framing. While the husband ends up returning to DT, it's more because of the marital argument than a decision based on rational economics related to sunk costs.

The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues with an endeavor because they've already invested time, money, or effort into it, even if continuing is no longer the rational choice. They are factoring past, unrecoverable costs into their decision-making.

In this case, you *are* trying to get your money back. You are not continuing with the plan *because* you've already invested money. Instead, you are trying to *cut your losses* by withdrawing from a situation that is no longer beneficial or suitable for you, even though you have already spent money, which demonstrates rational economic behaviour.. This is the opposite of the sunk cost fallacy. The social pressure from your friends doesn't change the underlying economic principles at play.

",0,"This scenario doesn't directly involve the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when someone continues to invest in a losing endeavor because they've already invested so much time, money, or effort into it, even when it's clear that continuing is not the most rational decision.

In this case, the woman's decision to leave the dinner and go to her room wasn't based on prior investment. It was a reaction to a current, emotionally charged situation – her father's behavior and its impact on her relationship. She wasn't weighing past investments against potential future outcomes; she was reacting to an immediate emotional distress. Therefore, this scenario doesn't fit the definition of the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

",0,"This is a clear example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The woman is considering staying in an unfulfilling and unbalanced marriage primarily because she has already invested 6 years into the relationship (the ""sunk cost""). She's allowing her past investment of time, emotional energy, and financial resources to influence her decision about whether to stay, rather than evaluating the relationship based on its current merit and future prospects.

The key elements that make this a Sunk Cost Fallacy include:

1. She's hesitant to leave despite clear evidence that the relationship is dysfunctional
2. She's considering the time already invested (6 years) as a reason to stay
3. She's continuing to invest resources (money, effort, time) into a situation that shows no signs of improvement
4. She's expressing fear of the ""unknown of leaving"" while implicitly using the time already invested as a reason to stay

The rational approach would be to evaluate the relationship based on its current state and future prospects, regardless of past investments. The time, money, and emotional energy already invested cannot be recovered regardless of whether she stays or leaves, and therefore shouldn't be a factor in the decision-making process.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

The boyfriend's reaction and the narrator's analysis of it relate more to issues of gender bias and communication in relationships rather than any decision-making based on prior investments.

If the narrator had said something like ""I need to stay in this relationship because I've already invested two years in it, even though these views make me deeply uncomfortable,"" that would be closer to a Sunk Cost Fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"This appears to be a complex situation that involves both emotional and financial considerations. The bride's reasoning that they should continue with the venue ""because we've already put in so much"" is indeed an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. She's letting previous investments (time, money, and emotional investment) influence the decision to continue, rather than evaluating the current situation on its own merits.

However, it's worth noting that there are also valid practical reasons to continue with the current venue:
1. The proximity to the wedding date (3 months)
2. Existing arrangements with other vendors
3. Guests have already been invited
4. The actual concerns (portaloos and sound system) might not be significant enough to warrant a venue change

The sunk cost element becomes apparent when the bride focuses on what they've already invested rather than whether the venue still meets their needs going forward. The statement ""I feel like it's too late to stop now because we've already put in so much"" directly demonstrates this fallacy.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when someone continues an endeavor or behavior because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even when it's no longer rational to do so. For example, if the person insisted on forcing their husband to eat the cake or refused to throw it away even after it had gone bad just because they spent time making it, that would be a Sunk Cost Fallacy.

In this case, the person is simply expressing natural disappointment over their effort not being appreciated or acknowledged by their husband. Their feelings are about the emotional impact of their husband's behavior rather than trying to justify continuing an irrational course of action based on past investments.

The cousin's behavior seems to stem from a desire for recognition and an ongoing competition with the narrator, not from being unable to let go of past investments.

If the cousin were, for example, pursuing additional degrees she didn't need solely because she had already invested so much time in academia, that would be closer to a Sunk Cost Fallacy. But this situation is more about personal rivalry and self-validation.

My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?

",0,"This situation does not represent a Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when someone continues an investment or behavior because of past investments, even when it's no longer rational to do so. 

This scenario instead describes an emotional reaction to verbal abuse and public humiliation. The narrator's decision to leave the situation was actually a healthy response to toxic behavior, not a decision based on previous investments or commitments.

If anything, staying in an emotionally harmful situation just because dinner was already planned would have been closer to a Sunk Cost Fallacy.

The question ""Should I have stayed?"" isn't about previously invested resources affecting future decisions (which would be a Sunk Cost Fallacy), but rather about appropriate social responses to an uncomfortable and emotionally damaging situation.

",0," ANSWER: Yes

The scenario you've described does indeed seem to involve the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on past investments, rather than considering the current and future costs and benefits.

In this case, you have invested significant time, effort, and emotional energy into your marriage. However, it appears that the current situation is not beneficial for you, and continuing in the marriage may not yield positive results in the future. Yet, you mention feeling scared to leave due to the time and effort already invested, which suggests the sunk cost fallacy might be at play.

It's important to remember that past investments should not dictate future decisions. Instead, you should focus on what will make you happier and healthier moving forward. If staying in the marriage does not provide those benefits, it may be time to consider other options, regardless of the time and effort invested up to this point.",,yes,

The situation you've described is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. While the fallacy typically refers to financial decisions, it can also apply to personal relationships and other areas of life. In this case, your boyfriend has invested time and energy into his negative feelings towards Rachel Zegler, and he's struggling to let go of those feelings, even when it's clear that they're disproportionate to the actual issue at hand (Rachel Zegler's comments about Snow White). He's clinging to his investment (time and energy) in his negative opinion of her, and this is clouding his judgment and causing him to overlook the fact that his criticisms are unfounded and based on her confidence, political views, and expressiveness, rather than her actual actions or behavior. This is a classic example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as he's continuing to invest time and energy into a negative situation (his dislike of Rachel Zegler) that he should probably let go of.",,no,

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

The situation described in the example appears to be an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The individual is considering the money and time already invested in the wedding (the sunk costs) as a reason to continue with the original plan, even though it may not be the best decision moving forward. This is a fallacy because the sunk costs should not influence the decision about whether to postpone or change the wedding venue. The focus should be on the current and future costs and benefits, not the past investments. In this case, the individual is emotionally invested in the wedding and wants to proceed, but the fiancé is raising valid concerns about the venue that could impact the quality of the wedding day. The individual's emotional attachment to the wedding and the sunk costs are clouding their judgment, leading to the Sunk Cost Fallacy.",,yes,

So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly.

The situation you've described is an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on past investments rather than on the current and future costs and benefits.

In your case, you've invested time, effort, and resources into making the Tres Leches cake for your husband and his friends. However, your husband's lack of interest in eating the cake, despite the time that has passed, should not influence your decision to continue offering it to him. The fact that you've already invested time and effort into making the cake should not affect your current decision-making process.

It's understandable that you feel disappointed and crestfallen, but it's important to recognize that the sunk cost (the time and effort you've already invested) should not influence your current decisions. If you continue to offer the cake to your husband and he continues to decline, it may be best to stop offering it and move on.",,no,
Sunk Cost Fallacy,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.

The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that causes people to make decisions based on past investments, rather than the potential value of future options. In this case, your wife is exhibiting this fallacy by insisting that you should continue to wait at Discount Tire, even though the initial 15-minute favor has turned into an hour-long ordeal.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

The situation you've described appears to be an instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when people continue to invest time, money, or resources into a decision based on previously invested resources, rather than making a decision based solely on the current and future costs and benefits.

In your case, you've already contributed money towards the gathering, which could be considered a sunk cost. However, the decision to attend or not should be based on the current and future costs and benefits, such as your allergies and diet restrictions, the enjoyment you would get from the gathering, and the potential harm to your budget if you were to attend and not be able to eat the provided food.

The fact that you've already contributed money should not influence your decision to attend or not, as that money is sunk and cannot be recovered. By asking for your money back, you are not causing harm to the budget, as you would not have been attending and contributing to the budget in the first place.

It's understandable that your friends might feel frustrated if your decision to back out affects their budget, but it's important to remember that you should make decisions based on what is best for you, not based on sunk costs. In this case, it would be best for you to stick to your decision and not let the sunk cost of the money you've already contributed influence your decision to attend or not.",,no,

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

",0,"This scenario could be an instance of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**, depending on the reasoning behind the decision to stay in the marriage. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort, etc.), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. 

In this case, the wife has invested **6 years** in the relationship (4 of them married), and she may be staying because of the time and emotional energy she has already committed, rather than because the relationship is fulfilling or healthy. She explicitly mentions being ""too scared of the unknown of leaving,"" which suggests fear and attachment to the past investment are influencing her decision-making, rather than a rational assessment of her current and future well-being. 

The relationship appears one-sided, with her carrying nearly all the financial, emotional, and domestic burdens while receiving little support or intimacy in return. If she is staying primarily because of the time already spent (rather than hope for improvement or genuine happiness), then this aligns with the sunk cost fallacy. 

However, if she were staying for other reasons (e.g., love, hope for change, external pressures), it might not strictly fit the definition. But given the details provided—especially her hesitation due to the length of the relationship and fear of the unknown—the sunk cost fallacy seems to be a significant factor.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"The example provided does **not** clearly demonstrate the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. Here’s why:

The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** occurs when someone continues an endeavor (or persists with a decision) primarily because of the resources (time, money, effort) already invested, even if abandoning it would be more rational or beneficial. In this case, the person is emotionally attached to the wedding as planned and feels it’s ""too late to stop now"" because of the deposits paid, invitations sent, and plans made. However, their primary reasoning isn’t purely about the sunk costs—it’s also about:  
- Their strong emotional desire to marry their partner (""I just want to get married to him and have a great day"").  
- The practical and emotional investment in the event (kids’ excitement, guests invited, preparations in place).  
- Their belief that the issues raised (portaloos, sound system) are minor compared to the value of the wedding itself.  

The fiancé’s concerns are about quality (e.g., ""sub par"" wedding), while the person’s reluctance to change venues stems more from attachment to the event as planned and a disagreement over priorities—not just a refusal to ""waste"" the deposit. The emotional and logistical weight of reorganizing the wedding also plays a role, which goes beyond the classic sunk cost fallacy.  

That said, there’s a *hint* of sunk-cost thinking in the phrase ""we’ve already put in so much,"" but it’s not the dominant or decisive factor in their reasoning. The core conflict is about differing expectations and values for the wedding, not an irrational commitment to a failing course of action due to prior investment.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"To determine whether this scenario is an instance of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**, let's first define the concept. The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** occurs when someone continues a behavior or endeavor based on previously invested resources (time, money, effort, etc.) that cannot be recovered, rather than making a rational decision based on current circumstances. In other words, it's the tendency to ""throw good money after bad"" because of past investments, even when it no longer makes sense to do so.

In this example:
1. **Your Investment**: You spent significant effort making the Tres Leches cake for your husband's gathering, which turned out to be poorly attended. You now feel disappointed that he hasn't tried it despite your hard work.
2. **Your Emotional Response**: You're upset because you feel your effort is being wasted or unappreciated, and you're fixated on getting him to eat the cake to ""validate"" the time and effort you put into it.
3. **Rational Decision vs. Emotional Reaction**: The rational approach would be to accept that the cake is already made (the effort is ""sunk"") and that your husband's lack of interest doesn't negate your effort. Instead, you're lingering on the disappointment and pushing him to eat it, even though it's clear he's not interested at the moment.

However, this situation is **not a perfect example** of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. While there are elements of emotional investment and disappointment over ""wasted"" effort, the primary issue seems to be about **emotional validation** (feeling unappreciated) rather than a irrational commitment to a course of action due to prior investment. You're not continuing to bake more cakes or insisting on hosting more events because of the sunk cost; you're hurt by his lack of engagement with your effort.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy would be more clearly demonstrated if, for example, you kept forcing the cake on him or baking more desserts to ""make up for"" the initial wasted effort, despite his disinterest. Here, the focus is more on feelings of neglect or unreciprocated care.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"To determine whether this scenario is an instance of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**, let's first define the concept and then analyze the situation.

### What is the Sunk Cost Fallacy?
The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** occurs when someone continues investing time, money, or effort into a decision or activity simply because they have already invested resources into it, even when the costs outweigh the benefits or when abandoning the activity would be more rational. The fallacy lies in prioritizing past investments (which cannot be recovered) over future outcomes.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
1. **Initial Agreement**: The husband agrees to a quick 15-minute favor (driving the car to DT for tire inflation) because the expected cost (time away from work) is low and the benefit (fixing the tire) is high. This is rational.
   
2. **Unexpected Development**: At DT, the situation changes—the tire is ""basically flat,"" and the repair will take an additional 30+ minutes. The husband now faces a choice:
   - **Option 1**: Stay and wait, incurring a higher time cost (delaying work) for the same benefit (fixing the tire).
   - **Option 2**: Leave and return later (e.g., have the wife handle it, as she is already done with work), minimizing work disruption.

3. **Wife's Reaction**: The wife insists he stay, seemingly prioritizing the time already spent (the trip to DT) over the more efficient solution (her handling it). She escalates emotionally when he refuses, suggesting she views his departure as a waste of the initial effort.

4. **Husband's Return to DT**: After the argument, the husband goes back to DT, seemingly to ""make up"" for the conflict, even though this is less efficient (working late, additional time spent). This could be interpreted as a sunk cost response—feeling compelled to ""see it through"" due to the emotional and time investment already made.

### Is This the Sunk Cost Fallacy?
- **Wife's Perspective**: She may be falling into the sunk cost trap by insisting he stay simply because he's already there, ignoring the better alternative (her taking over). Her emotional reaction suggests she values the ""wasted"" trip over the logical solution.
- **Husband's Final Decision**: His return to DT after the argument could also reflect sunk cost thinking—trying to ""salvage"" the situation by doubling down on the initial plan, even though it’s now less rational.

However, the primary driver of the conflict seems to be **miscommunication and emotional reactivity** rather than a pure sunk cost calculation. The wife's anger stems from perceived neglect or lack of cooperation, not just a rationalization of past effort. The husband's return to DT is more about appeasement than a belief that the initial investment must be justified.

### Conclusion:
While elements of the sunk cost fallacy are present (e.g., insistence on continuing the original plan despite better alternatives), the core issue is interpersonal conflict rather than a cognitive bias about resource allocation. Thus, it’s not a clear-cut example of the sunk cost fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"This scenario does **not** appear to be an instance of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. Here's why:

The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when someone continues investing time, money, or effort into a decision purely because they've already committed resources to it, even when abandoning it would be the better choice. In this case, you initially contributed money with the expectation that the budget would accommodate your dietary restrictions, as agreed. When the budget was made without your input and included items you couldn't eat, you rationally decided to withdraw. 

Your decision to ask for your money back is not based on an irrational commitment to the original plan due to prior investment (the hallmark of the Sunk Cost Fallacy). Instead, it’s a reasonable response to a breach of the initial agreement. You’re not insisting on attending despite the poor fit; you’re cutting your losses because the conditions no longer work for you. The pressure from H and her friends to stay in (to avoid ""damage to their budget"") could be seen as them invoking a sunk cost mindset (i.e., ""you’ve already paid, so just go along with it""), but your actions don’t reflect the fallacy. 

Thus, your behavior is not an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"This scenario does **not** appear to be an instance of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. The Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to the tendency to continue investing time, money, or effort into a decision or endeavor based on the resources already committed (which cannot be recovered), rather than making a rational choice about future actions. For example, continuing to attend a bad movie because you paid for the ticket, even though you’re not enjoying it, would be a sunk cost fallacy.

In this case, the conflict revolves around **ego, validation, and perceptions of intelligence**, not an irrational commitment to a past investment. The cousin is demanding recognition for her PhD and intelligence, while the narrator disputes her claim based on broader criteria (e.g., wit, adaptability). Neither party is persisting in a course of action because of prior investments (e.g., time in a PhD program); instead, they’re arguing over subjective judgments of intelligence and self-worth. 

The cousin’s anger might stem from insecurity or a desire for validation, but this isn’t the same as clinging to a failing endeavor due to sunk costs. Similarly, the narrator’s refusal to concede isn’t based on prior investments but on their own assessment of intelligence.

Thus, this is a interpersonal conflict, not a demonstration of the sunk cost fallacy.

",0,"This scenario does **not** appear to be an instance of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. The Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to the tendency to continue investing time, money, or effort into something because of past investments, even when the current costs outweigh the benefits. For example, staying in a bad relationship because you've already spent years with the person, even if it no longer makes you happy.  

In your case, the situation revolves around an emotionally hurtful interaction with your father and your reaction to it. There is no indication that you were weighing past investments against future actions (the core of the Sunk Cost Fallacy). Instead, this seems to be about emotional distress, self-worth, and family dynamics.  

To address your other questions:  
- You were **not** an asshole or childish. Your father's comments were harsh and demeaning, and your reaction (withdrawing to process your emotions) was understandable.  
- Whether you ""should have stayed"" depends on what would have been healthiest for you in the moment. Sometimes, removing yourself from a toxic interaction is the best choice.  

If you were asking whether you should stay in the **relationship** with your boyfriend *despite* your father's behavior (e.g., because you've already invested time in it), *that* could involve the Sunk Cost Fallacy—but that doesn't seem to be the focus here.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. Hmm. So first, I need to recall what the sunk cost fallacy is. From what I remember, the sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like ""throwing good money after bad"" because you don't want to feel like your past investments were wasted.

Now, looking at the example given. The woman has been in a relationship for 6 years, married for 4. She's the sole income earner, does all the chores, and her husband isn't contributing. He got a job after 5 years but doesn't help financially at home. No intimacy for 3 years. She's considering leaving but is scared of the unknown. 

So, the key here is whether she's staying because of the time already invested. She mentions being scared to leave, but does she explicitly mention staying because of the 6 years together? The sunk cost fallacy would involve her reasoning like, ""I've spent so many years with him, I can't leave now."" But in her case, she's more focused on the fear of the unknown rather than the past investment. 

Wait, but sometimes people conflate fear of change with sunk costs. The sunk cost is about past investments influencing current decisions. If she's staying because of the time already spent, that's sunk cost. If she's staying because she's afraid of what comes next (like being alone, financial instability, etc.), that's different. 

In her case, she says she's ""been too scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap."" So her hesitation is more about future uncertainty rather than past investments. However, sometimes the sunk cost fallacy can be intertwined with other factors. Maybe part of her feels that after 6 years, it's a waste to leave now. But the primary reason she gives is fear of the unknown. 

The sunk cost fallacy specifically refers to continuing because of past investments. If her main reason isn't the time already spent, but rather fear of the future, then it's not a sunk cost. However, if the time invested is a significant factor in her staying (even if not explicitly stated), then it could be. But in the given text, she doesn't mention the time invested as a reason to stay. The reason is fear. 

So, I think this isn't a clear case of sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost would be if she said, ""I can't leave after all these years together,"" but here the fear is about what comes next. Therefore, the answer would be no.
</think>

The scenario described does not clearly align with the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues a course of action primarily due to the time, effort, or resources already invested, even when persisting leads to further harm or no benefit. In this case, the individual expresses hesitation about leaving the marriage due to fear of the ""unknown"" (e.g., uncertainty about life after divorce, potential loneliness, or logistical challenges) rather than explicitly citing the six-year relationship or four-year marriage as a reason to stay. While the duration of the relationship could implicitly contribute to her reluctance, the stated motivation centers on anxiety about future consequences rather than clinging to past investments. Her focus on fear of change—not a desire to avoid ""wasting"" prior commitments—suggests other psychological or emotional factors (e.g., loss aversion, risk aversion) are at play, rather than the sunk cost fallacy specifically.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the sunk cost fallacy actually is. From what I recall, the sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like, ""I've already spent so much on this, I can't quit now,"" even when quitting would be better.

Now, looking at the example given. The scenario describes a boyfriend ranting about Rachel Zegler, criticizing her for various personal traits and her comments about Snow White. The girlfriend feels that his anger is actually about discomfort with confident women, not Zegler herself. The boyfriend accuses her of only defending Zegler because of feminism, implying she doesn't genuinely like her. The conversation leaves her drained and questioning if it's patriarchal nonsense.

Wait, where's the sunk cost here? The sunk cost fallacy involves continuing an investment based on past costs. The example here seems more about gender dynamics, maybe sexism or misogyny. The boyfriend's behavior is about disliking a woman's confidence and expression, not about persisting in a decision because of prior investments. The girlfriend isn't talking about sticking with something because of past investments either. She's defending her opinion against his accusations. 

So the key elements of sunk cost are not present here. There's no mention of continuing a project, relationship, or activity because of time or resources already spent. Instead, the conflict is about differing opinions and possible sexist attitudes. The boyfriend's argument might be fallacious in other ways, like ad hominem attacks or straw man arguments, but not sunk cost. 

Therefore, the answer would be no. The example doesn't involve the sunk cost fallacy. It's more about gender bias and how the boyfriend is reacting to a woman's assertiveness.
</think>

The described scenario does not involve the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when someone continues investing time, money, or effort into a decision or activity *solely* because they have already incurred costs, even when persisting no longer serves their best interests. For example, continuing to watch a terrible movie because you paid for the ticket, even though you’re miserable, would be a classic case. 

In the example provided, the conflict revolves around the boyfriend’s hostility toward Rachel Zegler and his projection of discomfort with confident, outspoken women onto her. His criticisms (e.g., attacking her demeanor, policing her feminism) and the girlfriend’s defense of Zegler relate to gender dynamics, misogynistic stereotypes, and patriarchal attitudes—not to a decision influenced by prior investments. There is no indication that either party is persisting in a course of action due to sunk costs. Instead, the tension arises from clashing values and interpretations of feminism, not from a rationalization based on past commitments. 

The boyfriend’s behavior could be analyzed through other frameworks (e.g., sexism, ad hominem attacks, straw-manning feminism), but the Sunk Cost Fallacy does not apply here. The girlfriend’s exhaustion stems from confronting regressive gender norms, not from being trapped in a situation due to prior investments.

He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example provided is an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. So first, I need to recall what the sunk cost fallacy is. From what I remember, the sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like, ""I've already spent so much on this, I can't back out now,"" even if backing out would be better.

Looking at the example: the person and their fiancé have planned a wedding, paid a deposit, and made arrangements. The fiancé now wants to postpone and find a new venue because of issues like portaloos and the sound system. The person is devastated and feels it's too late to stop because they've already put in so much (deposit, guests invited, suit, photographer, etc.). They just want to get married despite the issues, while the fiancé is concerned about the quality.

The key here is the reasoning. The person wants to proceed because they've already invested time, money, and effort (the deposit, planning, etc.), not necessarily because continuing is the best decision. If the main reason to go ahead is the prior investment, even if changing plans might lead to a better outcome (as the fiancé suggests), then that's sunk cost fallacy. But wait, the person also mentions they don't care about the issues the fiancé is raising. So their desire to continue isn't just about the sunk costs; they genuinely don't mind the venue's shortcomings. Hmm.

Wait, the sunk cost fallacy is when the decision is influenced by the irrecoverable costs. If the person is proceeding because they think the current plan is still the best option despite the costs, then it's not the fallacy. But if they feel they must proceed because they can't ""waste"" the deposit and prior arrangements, even if changing would be better, then it is. But in the example, the person's main reason seems to be that they don't mind the venue's issues and just want to get married. The sunk cost is part of their reasoning (""we’ve already put in so much""), but maybe their primary motivation is their personal preference. However, the statement ""I feel like it's too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much"" directly points to considering sunk costs as a reason to continue. Even if they don't mind the issues, the decision to not postpone is influenced by the prior investments. So that would be the fallacy here. The fiancé is considering the future benefits (better venue) versus costs (losing deposit, rearranging), but the person is focused on the past investments. So yes, this is an example of sunk cost fallacy.
</think>

The scenario described involves a couple disagreeing about whether to proceed with their current wedding venue. The fiancé wants to consider postponing to find a better venue due to concerns about portaloos and the sound system, while the author argues it is ""too late to stop now"" because they have already invested time, money, and effort into planning (e.g., deposits, invitations, arrangements). The author’s reasoning hinges significantly on the resources already committed, such as the non-refundable deposit and the logistical momentum of finalized plans. However, they also emphasize that they personally do not care about the venue’s shortcomings and prioritize marrying their partner over those details. 

The **sunk cost fallacy** occurs when prior investments (which cannot be recovered) unduly influence a decision to continue a course of action, even when abandoning it would lead to a better outcome. Here, the author’s statement about feeling it is ""too late"" due to sunk costs (e.g., deposits, planning efforts) aligns with the fallacy, as these costs are irrelevant to the future value of the decision. If the fiancé’s concerns about the venue’s quality are valid and a better alternative exists, the rational choice would involve weighing future benefits against future costs (e.g., postponement fees, stress) rather than fixating on irrecoverable past investments. However, the author’s personal indifference to the venue’s flaws complicates this—they may genuinely prefer proceeding regardless of sunk costs. Still, the explicit mention of prior investments as a key reason to continue suggests the fallacy is at play in their reasoning.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if this situation is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the sunk cost fallacy is. From what I recall, the sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like throwing good money after bad because you already invested so much.

In the example given, the wife made a Tres Leches cake for her husband's friends. Only one friend came, so most of the cake is left. She's upset because her husband hasn't tried it even days later, despite her efforts. She feels hurt because she put in the work and he's not acknowledging it by eating some. Now, the question is: is her continuing to push him to eat the cake (or feeling upset that he doesn't) an example of sunk cost fallacy?

Wait, the sunk cost fallacy would involve her maybe insisting on making him eat it because she already spent time making it, even if eating it now isn't something he wants. But here, the husband isn't eating it, and she's upset. But is her feeling upset due to the sunk cost? Or is it more about feeling unappreciated?

The sunk cost fallacy usually applies when someone continues investing in a decision because of past investments, not emotional responses. The wife's main issue seems to be emotional—she feels unappreciated because her effort (the cake) isn't being acknowledged. The husband's lack of eating the cake isn't because of her past investment leading her to make further decisions (like forcing him to eat it despite him not wanting to), but rather her emotional response to his lack of appreciation.

Alternatively, if she were to keep pushing him to eat the cake just because she worked hard on it, even though he doesn't want to, that could be sunk cost. But in the scenario, she's considering stopping offering it. Her main point is feeling hurt, not necessarily continuing to invest more because of the past effort. So maybe this isn't sunk cost. The fallacy would be if she, say, made another cake next time even though he didn't eat this one, because she already put effort into the first. But here, she's just upset about the existing cake. The sunk cost is about continuing a behavior based on past costs, not the emotional response to the costs already incurred.

So I think the answer here is no. The situation is more about feeling unappreciated rather than irrationally continuing an action because of prior investment. The sunk cost fallacy would involve her making further decisions (like insisting he eat it) based on the prior effort, but she's instead reacting emotionally to his lack of acknowledgment. Therefore, it's not an example of the sunk cost fallacy.
</think>

The scenario described does not fit the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues investing time, effort, or resources into a decision *because of past investments*, even when the current costs or negative outcomes outweigh the benefits. For example, forcing someone to eat a cake solely because of the effort already spent making it, despite clear disinterest, could reflect the fallacy. 

In this case, the wife’s distress stems from feeling unappreciated due to her husband’s lack of acknowledgment of her effort, not from irrationally persisting in a course of action based on prior investments. She is not demanding he eat the cake to justify her work (e.g., insisting he consume it despite disliking it), but rather expressing hurt over his indifference. Her emotional response relates to unmet expectations of reciprocity or recognition, not a logical error tied to sunk costs. While her effort (the sunk cost) is a factor in her frustration, the core issue is interpersonal, not a continuation of a flawed decision-making process driven by past investments.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this situation is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. So, first, what's the sunk cost fallacy? From what I remember, it's when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. Like, you keep going to a bad movie because you already paid for the ticket, even though you're not enjoying it.

In the scenario here, the person agreed to take their wife's car to Discount Tire for a quick air check, expecting it to take 15 minutes. But when they got there, one tire was too low, and the shop said they needed to wait half an hour for a repair. The person wanted to go back to work, but the wife wanted them to stay. The argument ensued, and eventually, the person went back to wait, even though it would make them work late.

Wait, so the sunk cost would be the time already invested in driving to DT. But the person initially agreed to a 15-minute task, which turned into a longer one. When they decided to go back and wait, was that because they felt they had already invested time and didn't want to 'waste' it? Or was it more about conflict avoidance with the wife?

Hmm. The key point is whether the decision to go back (after initially leaving) was influenced by the time already spent. Let me break it down. The person first went to DT, found out it would take longer, called the wife, and she wanted them to stay. They argued, then the person left, but after the argument, they went back. The wife's reaction was strong, leading to the person returning to DT even though it would disrupt their work.

But the sunk cost fallacy here would be if, say, the person thought, ""I already spent 15 minutes driving here, I have to stay now even though it's not worth it."" But in the story, the person initially tried to leave because they needed to work. The wife pressured them, leading to an argument. The person then gives in and goes back. That seems more like a response to the wife's demands rather than considering prior time invested. Alternatively, maybe the person felt that since they started the task, they should finish it despite the added time. But I'm not sure. The main conflict here is between the wife's insistence and the work commitment. The sunk cost fallacy would be if the person's decision to continue was based on prior investment, not current circumstances. 

Wait, the person went back after the argument. So perhaps they felt that leaving would waste the time they already spent? But the problem was the tire needed repair. The sunk cost might not apply here because the decision to go back was more about resolving the marital conflict rather than the time already spent. The person's initial time wasn't a factor in their decision to return; instead, it was the wife's reaction. Alternatively, maybe the wife was the one influenced by sunk cost. Like, she wanted the time already spent (her husband going there) to not be wasted, so she insisted he stay. But the example is about the person's actions. The question is whether the person backing out and then returning is an instance of sunk cost.

Alternatively, when the person initially agreed to go, maybe they felt compelled to stay because they had already started, but in reality, the optimal choice would be to leave. But in the story, the person tried to leave, then after the argument, they returned. So their decision to return might not be based on sunk costs but on trying to appease the wife. Therefore, maybe the sunk cost fallacy isn't at play here. The key is whether the decision was influenced by past investments (time already spent) rather than future benefits. The person's main concern was work, and after the argument, they went back to avoid conflict. So the sunk cost fallacy isn't the driving factor here. Therefore, the answer would be no.
</think>

The scenario described does **not** qualify as an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues investing time, money, or effort into a decision **because of prior investments**, even when the current costs outweigh the benefits of continuing. In this case, the individual initially agreed to a 15-minute favor (driving to Discount Tire) but faced an unexpected extension of the task. Their decision to leave and return home was driven by a rational assessment of their work obligations and the urgency of the tire issue (e.g., confirming with the mechanic that driving home was safe). The subsequent choice to return to Discount Tire after the argument appears motivated by interpersonal conflict resolution (to appease their wife) rather than a desire to justify the time already spent. 

The wife’s insistence that they stay at DT might reflect frustration or miscommunication, but neither party’s actions hinge on clinging to prior investments. The individual’s initial attempt to leave was pragmatic, and their eventual return stemmed from relational pressure, not an irrational commitment to ""sunk"" time. The key factor here is conflict avoidance and emotional dynamics, not the sunk cost fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. First, I need to recall what the sunk cost fallacy is. From what I remember, the sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like throwing good money after bad because you've already invested so much.

In the example, the person (let's call them the poster) saved up money to contribute to a group event. They agreed on a budget that would consider everyone's dietary restrictions. However, when the budget was made, it didn't accommodate their allergies. The poster decided not to go and asked for their money back. The friends are upset because withdrawing the money affects their budget and call the poster petty.

Now, applying the sunk cost fallacy here. The key point is whether the poster is continuing to participate (or not) based on the money already contributed. The sunk cost fallacy would be if the poster decided to attend the event despite the food issues just because they already paid, even though attending would be unpleasant. But in this case, the poster is choosing not to attend and wants their money back. They aren't letting the sunk cost (the money they contributed) influence their decision to go despite the problems. Instead, they're cutting their losses by not attending and trying to get the money back. The friends are pressuring them to stay in, possibly because they don't want to adjust the budget (which could be about their own sunk costs). However, the poster's decision itself doesn't seem to be influenced by their prior investment. They're making a rational choice to avoid a situation that doesn't meet their needs, even though they already spent money. So the fallacy isn't on the poster's part. The friends might be experiencing it if they're insisting on keeping the budget as is because they've already planned around the contributions, but the question is about the poster's action. Therefore, the example isn't an instance of the sunk cost fallacy by the poster.
</think>

The scenario described does **not** involve the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues investing time, money, or effort into a decision (even when it is no longer rational) because they feel compelled to justify resources already spent, rather than evaluating the current and future costs and benefits. 

In this case, the poster initially contributed money to a group event but later decided to withdraw after discovering the budget did not accommodate their dietary restrictions. Their decision to leave was based on the event no longer meeting their needs (e.g., safety concerns due to allergies), not on a desire to justify their prior contribution. The poster is attempting to *recover* their sunk cost (by asking for a refund) rather than irrationally persisting in the plan to avoid ""wasting"" the money. The friends, however, may be exhibiting elements of the sunk cost fallacy if they insist on maintaining the original budget to avoid adjusting plans (due to the effort or money already spent), but the focus here is on the poster’s actions. Since the poster prioritized their well-being over recouping or justifying the initial contribution, their decision aligns with rational decision-making, not the sunk cost fallacy. 

ANSWER: No",no,no,1.0
Sunk Cost Fallacy,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the described situation is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the sunk cost fallacy is. From what I recall, the sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like continuing to invest in a failing project just because you've already spent a lot on it, rather than cutting your losses.

Looking at the example given: the cousin with a PhD insists that the narrator admit she's smarter. The narrator refuses, leading to an argument. The cousin's anger and need for validation are key points here. But where does the sunk cost fallacy come into play here?

Wait, the cousin has a PhD, which took a lot of time and effort. She might feel that because she invested so much into her education (the sunk cost), she should be recognized as smarter. If she's holding onto her PhD as a reason she's smarter despite the narrator's different success, maybe she's basing her claim on the effort (sunk cost) rather than current evidence of intelligence. But the argument here is more about validation and ego rather than continuing an investment because of past costs.

The sunk cost fallacy usually involves continuing an action because of past investments. In this scenario, the cousin isn't persisting in a failing action because of her PhD; she's using her PhD as a credential to assert superiority. The argument isn't about her continuing to invest in something that's not working. Instead, it's a clash of egos and validation. The cousin might be seeking recognition for her efforts, but that's not exactly the sunk cost fallacy. The fallacy is more about continuing to invest in a losing proposition because of prior investment, not using past achievements to claim current status.

So, in this case, the cousin's behavior isn't an example of the sunk cost fallacy. The narrator's refusal to acknowledge her intelligence doesn't involve her continuing to invest in something due to past costs. Instead, it's about her wanting validation for her accomplishments. The sunk cost fallacy isn't applicable here; it's more about pride and possibly a different type of cognitive bias, like maybe confirmation bias or ego defense.
</think>

The described scenario does not exemplify the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone persists in a decision or action primarily due to prior investments (time, money, effort, etc.), even when continuing leads to negative outcomes or abandoning the action would be more rational. For example, continuing to fund a failing project because of the money already spent, despite clear evidence it will not succeed.

In this case, the cousin’s insistence on being recognized as smarter stems from a desire for validation tied to her academic achievement (a PhD), which she views as proof of superior intelligence. Her anger and demand for acknowledgment relate to ego, pride, and possibly insecurity, rather than a commitment to a failing course of action because of prior investments. The argument centers on conflicting definitions of intelligence and a clash of egos, not a continuation of an unproductive endeavor due to sunk costs. While the cousin may feel her PhD justifies her claim, this is more about leveraging credentials for status rather than irrationally persisting in a losing effort because of past effort.

My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me.

I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example given is an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. First, I need to recall what the sunk cost fallacy is. From what I remember, the sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a behavior or endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if the current costs outweigh the benefits. It's like continuing to invest in a failing project just because you've already spent a lot on it, rather than cutting your losses.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person is a 19-year-old female whose boyfriend comes over for dinner. Her dad gets upset about a few water drops from her shoes, calls her disgusting, and makes her clean it while badmouthing her to the boyfriend. She gets upset, leaves, and the boyfriend leaves too. She's questioning if she was wrong, childish, etc.

Wait, but where does the sunk cost fallacy come into play here? The sunk cost fallacy typically involves continuing an investment based on past costs. The example here seems more about dealing with a family conflict and emotional response. The user is asking if her reaction (leaving the situation) is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. 

Hmm. Let me think. The sunk cost fallacy would apply if, for example, she stayed in a bad relationship because she had already invested a lot of time into it, even though it's not working. Or if the father insisted on her staying because they've had dinners for years, so they should continue despite current issues. But in this scenario, the main elements are the father's harsh criticism and her reaction. Her leaving might be an emotional response, but is it related to sunk costs?

Alternatively, if she stayed in the situation because she felt she had already put effort into the dinner (maybe cooking, preparing), then continuing despite the negative experience could be sunk cost. But she didn't stay; she left. The question is whether her actions (leaving) or the father's behavior involve sunk cost.

Wait, the father is talking about how bad she is, perhaps trying to influence the boyfriend. But I don't see a connection to sunk costs here. The key elements of sunk cost are prior investments influencing current decisions. The example here is about a conflict and emotional response, not about continuing an endeavor based on past investments. 

So the answer would be no, this isn't an instance of the sunk cost fallacy. The situation doesn't involve continuing a commitment due to prior investments. Instead, it's about handling criticism and emotional distress.
</think>

The scenario described does not involve the sunk cost fallacy. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues an action or commitment based on previously invested resources (time, money, effort, etc.) rather than evaluating the current or future costs and benefits. For example, staying in a failing relationship solely because of the years already invested would be a sunk cost fallacy. 

In this situation, the conflict arises from the father’s harsh criticism and the emotional response of the individual. The focus is on interpersonal dynamics, feelings of humiliation, and a decision to withdraw from the situation. The individual’s choice to leave the room reflects an emotional reaction to being publicly shamed, not a decision influenced by prior investments. The father’s behavior also does not relate to sunk costs; it stems from judgmental remarks and control, not a reliance on past investments to justify ongoing actions. 

The question of whether the individual was ""childish"" or ""an asshole"" pertains to social norms and emotional coping mechanisms, not economic or logical reasoning errors like the sunk cost fallacy. There is no indication that prior investments (e.g., time in the relationship, effort in family dinners) are being used to justify continuing a harmful or unproductive course of action. Instead, the scenario highlights emotional distress and conflict resolution.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

",0,"The scenario you've described does not directly relate to the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a cognitive bias where people continue to invest time, money, or effort into a situation because they've already invested a significant amount, even though the continued investment is not rational. In your case, while you may be continuing in the relationship due to the time and effort already invested, your primary concerns seem to be related to the imbalance of responsibilities, lack of intimacy, and emotional support.

Your hesitation to leave the marriage might be influenced by fear of the unknown, but this is not the same as continuing to invest in something because of past investments. It's important to consider your own well-being and happiness in making a decision about your future. If you feel overwhelmed and unsupported, it might be helpful to seek professional advice or counseling to help you navigate these feelings and make an informed decision.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

Sunk Cost Fallacy,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to the tendency to continue investing time, money, or effort into something because of the resources already spent on it, despite the fact that continuing with the project might not be beneficial. In the context provided, the concern seems to be more about the emotional and logistical commitments made rather than the financial investment (though financial aspects are mentioned). The primary focus is on the emotional distress caused by the suggestion of postponing or changing the wedding venue, rather than a decision to continue with the wedding because of the money already spent.

The individual is upset because they have made plans and commitments, and they are emotionally invested in the wedding happening as planned. They express a desire to proceed with the wedding regardless of the minor inconveniences mentioned by the fiancé. The concern about the portaloos and sound system is not about the financial sunk costs but about the potential for a less-than-perfect wedding day, which is causing the fiancé distress.

In summary, while the individual is concerned about the commitments already made, the primary issue seems to be emotional and logistical rather than purely financial. Therefore, this situation does not clearly exemplify the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

In your scenario, the focus is on the emotional and relational aspect of your husband not consuming the cake you made for his friends. Your feelings of disappointment and frustration stem from the effort you put into making the cake and the expectation that your husband would appreciate it. This is more about unmet expectations and communication within a relationship rather than a decision-making bias related to sunk costs.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"The scenario you've described does not directly relate to the concept of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Sunk Cost Fallacy refers to the tendency to continue investing in something because of the resources (time, money, effort) already invested, despite the fact that continuing to invest may not be the most rational or beneficial choice. In your situation, the primary issue seems to be a conflict between your work responsibilities and your wife's expectations for you to address an urgent car issue.

Your decision to return home after finding out the tire was not flat but underinflated was based on the need to get back to work, not on a desire to avoid losing time already spent on the errand. You made a rational decision based on the information available at the time, and you were willing to return to Discount Tire after your workday to address the issue further.

The argument with your wife seems to stem from a misunderstanding and a difference in priorities rather than a fallacy related to sunk costs. Your wife's reaction might be influenced by her perception of the situation, but it does not illustrate the Sunk Cost Fallacy either. Her reaction could be attributed to other factors such as frustration, a feeling of being neglected, or a miscommunication about the urgency and nature of the tire issue.

In conclusion, the example provided does not illustrate the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The decisions made and the conflict that arose are more about immediate needs, priorities, and communication rather than an irrational continuation of an investment due to sunk costs.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

Your decision to back out and request a refund is based on the new information about the event, not on the initial investment you made.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

IKEA Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0,"The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on things they have partially created or assembled themselves. This phenomenon is often observed in customers who purchase and assemble furniture from IKEA, hence the name. When individuals are involved in the creation or assembly process, they tend to develop a sense of ownership and pride in the final product, which can lead to an inflated perception of its value.

In the given example, the general contractor has invested a significant amount of time (60 hours) and effort into creating a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door. By doing so, the contractor has developed a strong sense of ownership and pride in the project. The fact that they ""wanted to go above and beyond"" and ""add value and a special touch"" suggests that they were motivated to create something unique and valuable.

The contractor's frustration when the interior designer and client dismiss their work over a detail (the mailbox lock) is also consistent with the IKEA Effect. The contractor has become emotionally invested in the project and is more likely to defend their design choices, even if they may not be the most visually appealing. The fact that they didn't charge extra for the feature and were willing to put in extra effort to ensure the cabinet's functionality further reinforces their emotional investment in the project.

The IKEA Effect can also be observed in the contractor's perception of the client's and interior designer's criticism. The contractor feels that their work is being ""dismissed"" over a minor detail, which suggests that they are overvaluing their own contribution to the project. This is a classic symptom of the IKEA Effect, where individuals overestimate the value of their own creations due to their emotional investment in the process.

Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do.

In the provided text, the author is expressing frustration and hurt feelings because others do not seem to be interested in listening to them talk about their favorite topics, such as movies. The author feels that they put a lot of effort and emotion into explaining and discussing these topics, but others do not reciprocate with the same level of interest or attention.

While the author's feelings of frustration and hurt are understandable, this scenario does not appear to be an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect typically involves a situation where someone has invested physical or creative effort into creating something, and as a result, they overvalue it. In contrast, the author's situation involves a social interaction where they feel that their emotional investment and enthusiasm for a particular topic are not being reciprocated by others.

The author's feelings of frustration and hurt seem to be more related to a desire for social connection, understanding, and validation, rather than an overvaluation of something they have created or assembled themselves.

In the context of the provided example, the situation involves a person who has spent time and effort making a Tres Leches cake for their husband's gathering. The husband's lack of interest in trying the cake, despite the effort invested in making it, has led to feelings of disappointment and frustration.

However, the IKEA Effect typically involves the person who has created something overvaluing it, not the recipient of the creation. In this case, it is the husband who is the recipient of the cake, and his lack of interest in trying it is what's causing the issue.

The feelings of disappointment and frustration experienced by the person who made the cake can be attributed to the emotional investment they have in the cake, as well as the effort they put into making it. This emotional investment can lead to expectations that the husband will appreciate and enjoy the cake, which is not being met.

Therefore, the situation described is not an instance of the IKEA Effect, as it involves the recipient's lack of interest rather than the creator's overvaluation of the creation.

IKEA Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

This phenomenon is often attributed to the psychological investment and sense of ownership that comes with creating or assembling something with one's own hands.

In the context of the provided example, the situation does not appear to be directly related to the IKEA Effect. The scenario describes a family discussion about vacation plans, which escalates into a heated argument involving personal insults and criticisms. The father's behavior and comments seem to be driven by his own biases, prejudices, and emotional reactions, rather than any issues related to self-assembly or creation of something.

The IKEA Effect typically involves a positive emotional response to self-created or self-assembled objects, whereas the situation described is marked by conflict, hurtful comments, and negative emotions. The father's insistence on staying in a hotel and having someone else handle breakfast is not related to any sense of pride or ownership in creating or assembling something, but rather seems to be driven by his own preferences and biases.

IKEA Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on things they have partially created or assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA. This phenomenon is often observed in situations where individuals have invested time, effort, or resources into creating something, and as a result, they develop a strong emotional attachment to it.

In the context of the given example, the sister's handmade gifts, specifically her paintings, can be seen as an instance of the IKEA Effect. She has invested her time and effort into creating these paintings, despite their perceived lack of quality or aesthetic value. The fact that she continues to make these gifts, even after receiving feedback in the form of Christmas lists or indicators of what her family members might like, suggests that she has a strong emotional attachment to her creations.

The sister's behavior is consistent with the IKEA Effect, as she seems to overvalue her handmade gifts and expects others to appreciate them equally. Her decision to make another painting as a gift, despite being aware that it may not be on her brother's wishlist, indicates that she is more invested in the process of creating something herself than in the actual value or usefulness of the gift.

The fact that the brother and his wife have never expressed their true feelings about the gifts, possibly due to not wanting to hurt the sister's feelings, has allowed this behavior to continue. The sister's perception of her own creations is likely influenced by the IKEA Effect, leading her to believe that her handmade gifts are more valuable and meaningful than they actually are.

The contrast between the sister's spending habits and her expectation that others will appreciate her handmade gifts is also noteworthy. While she and her husband spend significant amounts of money on dining out and other luxuries, she seems to expect others to appreciate the sentimental value of her gifts, rather than their monetary value.

Given this analysis, it appears that the sister's behavior is indeed an instance of the IKEA Effect, as she overvalues her handmade gifts and expects others to do the same.

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on things they have partially created or assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA. This phenomenon is often observed in situations where individuals have invested time, effort, and resources into creating or customizing something, which leads to a sense of ownership and attachment.

In the context of the example provided, the sister-in-law (SIL) has invested time and effort into creating handmade gifts, such as Christmas ornaments, self-made liqueur, and a painted tote bag. These gifts are likely to hold sentimental value and emotional significance for her, as she has poured her creativity and energy into crafting them.

The reaction of the wife, who defends her sister's DIY gifts and accuses the narrator of being ""bitter and ungrateful,"" suggests that she may be experiencing the IKEA Effect. She may be placing a high value on the gifts because they were made with love and care by her sister, and she may be perceiving the narrator's criticism as a personal attack on her sister's creativity and thoughtfulness.

However, the narrator's perspective is also worth considering. He may not appreciate the DIY gifts because they do not align with his personal tastes or preferences, and he may feel that they are not as valuable or useful as store-bought gifts. His comment about hoping his SIL doesn't gift him any more ""DIYed shit"" suggests that he values the thought and effort behind the gifts, but not the gifts themselves.

In this scenario, it is not the narrator who is experiencing the IKEA Effect, but rather his wife and possibly her sister. The narrator is not overvaluing the DIY gifts because he had a hand in creating them; instead, he is criticizing them because they do not meet his expectations.

IKEA Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

In the context of the provided example, the situation does not appear to be related to the IKEA Effect. The individual is discussing their relationship with their mother, their desire for independence, and their mother's overbearing behavior. The story revolves around the individual's decision to purchase a new phone, which does not involve any form of creation, assembly, or customization that would trigger the IKEA Effect.

The individual's actions and decisions are driven by their desire for autonomy, independence, and a sense of control over their life, rather than any attachment or value they have placed on something they have created or assembled themselves. The conflict with their mother stems from her attempts to exert control over the individual's life, which is a separate issue from the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,gpt-4o,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0,"The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially create. The idea is that labor leads to love, causing people to value the things they have had a hand in creating, often more than those same products would be valued by others.

In this example, the individual who built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door has spent a significant amount of time and effort on the project. The custom creation involved not just building the cabinet but also adding a functional element by installing a mailbox lock to ensure it stayed closed properly. Despite this effort, the client and interior designer have dismissed the element of the mailbox lock as unacceptable. The frustration expressed by the creator over this criticism suggests an attachment to the work, which is characteristic of the IKEA Effect. The builder likely ascribes greater value to the cabinet and the functional solution due to the personal investment of 60 hours of labor, even though others might not see it the same way.

Therefore, the builder's heightened appreciation for the cabinet, owing to the effort and creativity invested, aligns with the definition of the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,gpt-4o,"I hate it when I’m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like “I wasn’t paying attention”.

Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.

It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out.

This effect suggests that when individuals invest effort into building or assembling something, such as furniture from IKEA, they tend to develop an attachment or increased valuation of that item because of the effort they have put into it.

In the example provided, the focus is on a person's emotional experience during conversations about their interests, specifically movies, and the disappointment and hurt feelings that arise when others do not engage as actively or attentively. This situation is about the emotional investment in interpersonal communication and the desire for reciprocal engagement, rather than the increased valuation of something due to personal effort in its creation.

The scenario does not involve an individual placing higher value on an object or product because they went through the effort of assembling or creating it. Instead, it deals with a social dynamic and the value placed on mutual interest and attention in conversation.

This effect makes individuals value their own work greatly, often higher than the work done by others, due to the effort they personally invested in it.

In the situation described, the focus is on the individual's relationship with their mother and their desire for independence and privacy. The scenario revolves around familial control, tracking, and asserting independence, especially in light of a challenging parent-child relationship, rather than a situation where an individual places more value on something they've worked on or assembled themselves. 

There is no evidence that the person involved in this situation values any self-made product or situation more because of their personal input or effort. It's about their desire to be free from parental oversight now that they are an independent adult. Therefore, this example does not involve a scenario where the person derives increased value from something they have created or assembled themselves.

IKEA Effect,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0,"Yes, the provided example strongly suggests the presence of the IKEA effect. The general contractor invested significant time (60 hours) and effort into building the custom cabinet/attic access door. This personal investment leads to an inflated sense of value regarding the project, specifically the functionality provided by the mailbox lock. The designer's and client's criticism of the lock, despite its functional purpose, is frustrating to the contractor because it undermines the perceived value derived from the effort expended. The contractor feels a stronger connection and positive bias towards their own creation due to their labor, making it harder to objectively evaluate the aesthetic aspect criticized by the designer and client. The reluctance to change it despite external feedback aligns with the core idea of the IKEA effect: overvaluing self-made objects.

Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do.

IKEA Effect,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

IKEA Effect,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to place a disproportionately high value on objects they partially assemble themselves, regardless of the quality of the end result.

The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place disproportionately high value on products they partially created themselves. In this case, while the sister-in-law is creating paintings, the core issue isn't about her overvaluing her own creations because she assembled or made them (though this might be happening to some degree).

The situation described is more about:
1. Inequitable gift exchange
2. Mismatched expectations about gift-giving
3. Potentially poor social awareness
4. Financial imbalance in gift-giving relationships

The IKEA Effect specifically refers to when people value things more because they put effort into creating them (like assembling IKEA furniture). While the sister-in-law might value her own paintings highly, the main focus of this story is about the social dynamics of gift-giving and the frustration of receiving unwanted handmade items rather than about the creator's attachment to their own work.

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"This situation is not a clear example of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect refers to people placing higher value on products they partially created themselves, leading them to overvalue their own creations. In this case, we're seeing the opposite perspective - someone who received DIY gifts and doesn't value them, while others (the creator and family members) do value them highly.

If we were analyzing the sister-in-law's perspective, where she potentially overvalues her own DIY creations because she made them herself, that could be an example of the IKEA Effect. However, the story is told from the recipient's perspective, focusing on their lack of appreciation for handmade gifts rather than the creator's attachment to their work.

The conflict here seems more related to different gift-giving preferences and varying perceptions of the value of handmade items, rather than the psychological phenomenon of overvaluing something because you made it yourself.

IKEA Effect,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

IKEA Effect,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0," ANSWER: Yes

The example provided is an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that describes people's tendency to place a disproportionately high value on objects they partially created, even if the creation process was simple and the final product is not particularly impressive.

In this case, the individual spent a significant amount of time and effort (60 hours) to create a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door, going beyond the minimum requirement for the project. This effort resulted in a sense of personal attachment to the project, and the individual felt frustrated when their work was criticized, especially over a functional detail that was essential for the cabinet's proper functioning.

The IKEA Effect is often observed in situations where people assemble furniture from flat-pack kits, such as those sold by IKEA, and feel a sense of pride and ownership over the finished product, even if the final product is not particularly high-quality or aesthetically pleasing. In this case, the individual was not assembling furniture from a flat-pack kit, but the principle is the same: the individual invested time, effort, and creativity into the project, leading to a sense of personal attachment and a disproportionately high value placed on the final product.",,yes,

It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.
I love watching movies. I know it’s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it’s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it.

While the individual in the example expresses a strong emotional investment in discussing their interests, particularly movies, and feels frustrated when others seem disinterested, this scenario does not perfectly align with the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect refers to the phenomenon where people place a disproportionately high value on things they've partially assembled or personalized themselves. In this case, the individual is not describing a situation where they have invested time and effort into creating or assembling a conversation about movies, but rather expressing their disappointment when others do not share the same level of interest or attention.

Thanks in advance, I guess.",0," ANSWER: Yes

The scenario you've described does appear to be an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that suggests people place a disproportionately high value on objects they have partially built or created themselves. In your case, your husband's reluctance to eat the Tres Leches cake you made, despite expressing interest in it beforehand, could be attributed to the IKEA Effect.

You've put in effort and time to create the cake, and it's reasonable for you to feel a sense of pride and attachment to it. However, your husband might be experiencing a disconnect between the effort you've put into the cake and its actual value to him, which could be leading to his reluctance to eat it.

It's important to note that the IKEA Effect doesn't necessarily mean that your husband is being ungrateful or insensitive. Instead, it highlights the psychological phenomenon of people valuing things more highly when they've contributed to their creation.

In your case, you might want to discuss this with your husband and express your feelings about the situation. It's possible that he may not fully understand the impact his actions are having on you, and open communication could help resolve any misunderstandings.",,yes,
IKEA Effect,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

The IKEA Effect refers to the phenomenon where people place a disproportionately high value on objects they have assembled themselves, due to the effort and personal investment involved. In this case, the family is discussing vacation plans, not assembling furniture, and the father's behavior is not driven by a sense of personal investment or pride in his work, but rather by his frustration, insecurity, and potentially other underlying issues.

His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

The situation you've described appears to be an instance of the IKEA Effect, a cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on objects they partially created. Your sister-in-law's handmade gifts, despite their perceived low quality, hold significant value to her because she has invested time and effort in creating them.

However, it seems that the IKEA Effect is causing an imbalance in your relationship, as she continues to give unwanted gifts while you spend money on items she has specifically asked for. This is not fair, and it's reasonable for you to expect thoughtful, desired gifts in return.

While it's understandable that you might feel uncomfortable expressing your feelings directly, it's important to communicate your needs and expectations to maintain a healthy relationship. You could approach the conversation by expressing your appreciation for the thought behind the gifts, but emphasizing that you would prefer items from your wish list. It's also worth discussing the financial aspect, as it seems unfair that she spends money on luxuries while expecting you to accept unwanted gifts.

Ultimately, it's crucial to find a balance that respects both your financial contributions and her creative efforts. If a conversation doesn't yield results, you might need to reconsider the nature and frequency of gifts exchanged between your families.",,no,

The situation you've described appears to be an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to place a disproportionately high value on objects they have partially assembled or customized themselves. In this case, your sister-in-law has invested time and effort into creating DIY gifts for you, and as a result, she values them more than you do. This discrepancy in perceived value is at the heart of the IKEA Effect.

It's important to note that the IKEA Effect isn't necessarily a bad thing. In many cases, it can lead to people feeling more connected to and appreciative of the objects they've created. However, it can also lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as in your case.

It seems that your sister-in-law values the time and effort she put into creating the gifts, and feels that you should appreciate them as well. On the other hand, you value the gifts less because they don't meet your personal preferences or needs. This difference in valuation has led to a conflict.

To resolve this conflict, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your sister-in-law. Explain that you appreciate the thought and effort she put into the gifts, but that they don't quite meet your personal preferences. Suggest that in the future, she consider your preferences when choosing gifts, but also feel free to continue creating DIY gifts as an addition to a more traditional gift.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias that occurs when people place a disproportionately high value on objects they have partially assembled themselves. In your case, the ""object"" is the relationship with your mother, and the ""assembly"" is the control and monitoring she has exercised over you.

By buying a new phone that doesn't have the GPS tracking feature, you've essentially disassembled part of the relationship that was built on this control. This action has triggered a strong emotional response from your mother, as she perceives it as a threat to her ability to maintain that control. This response, in turn, has caused you to feel frustrated and overburdened, as you've been trying to establish your independence.

In this sense, the IKEA Effect is applicable because you've invested effort (both emotional and financial) into changing the dynamic of your relationship, and you now value this newfound independence highly. Your mother's attempts to reassemble the old relationship (by trying to get you to change your mind about the new phone) are seen as an attempt to undo the changes you've made, which you find undesirable.",,no,

Here’s why:

1. **Personal Investment**: You invested significant time (60 hours) and creativity into designing and building the custom cabinet, going beyond the basic requirement of a simple attic access. This effort reflects a personal attachment to the work.  
2. **Overvaluation of Your Contribution**: Despite the mailbox lock being functionally necessary, your frustration at its criticism suggests you value the entire project more highly because of the effort you put into it. This aligns with the IKEA Effect, where creators often overvalue their own work due to their involvement.  
3. **Non-Monetary Motivation**: You didn’t charge extra for the feature, indicating that the satisfaction of creating something unique was a driving force—another hallmark of the IKEA Effect, where labor leads to emotional attachment.  

While the IKEA Effect typically applies to consumers who assemble IKEA furniture and then value it more, it can also extend to professionals who take pride in their creations.

This effect is named after the Swedish furniture company IKEA, as customers often value the furniture they assemble themselves more highly than pre-assembled furniture, even if the end result is of lower quality. The key elements of the IKEA Effect are:  
1. **Personal effort or investment**: The individual has contributed time, energy, or emotion into creating or shaping something.  
2. **Increased valuation**: The individual values the outcome more because of their own involvement, regardless of its objective quality or others' opinions.  

In the example you provided, the speaker expresses frustration about not feeling heard or valued when discussing their passions (e.g., movies) with others. While this reflects a desire for reciprocity and emotional investment in conversations, it does not align with the IKEA Effect. Here’s why:  
- The speaker is not describing a situation where they have *created* or *assembled* something (e.g., a movie franchise or their thoughts) and thus value it more because of their effort. Instead, they are upset because others do not share their level of interest or engagement in the topic.  
- The IKEA Effect focuses on how *personal effort* inflates the value of one's own creations or contributions. The speaker’s frustration, however, stems from a lack of *external validation* or mutual engagement, not from overvaluing their own work due to effort.  

This scenario is more closely related to concepts like **emotional reciprocity** or the **need for belonging**, where the speaker desires others to match their level of enthusiasm or attention. The IKEA Effect, by contrast, would apply if the speaker valued their own interpretations or analyses of movies *more* because they had put thought into them, even if others disagreed.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending.

He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"The IKEA Effect refers to the cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products or outcomes they have partially created or contributed to. In this example, you (the wife) invested significant effort into making the Tres Leches cake for your husband and his friends, and you feel upset that your husband hasn’t tried it despite your hard work. However, the IKEA Effect typically applies to the creator's own valuation of their work, not someone else's valuation of it. 

In this case, you are the one who put effort into the cake, and you are disappointed that your husband doesn’t seem to value it as much as you do. This is more about your feelings of being unappreciated or your husband’s lack of engagement with your effort, rather than him overvaluing something he helped create. The IKEA Effect would be more relevant if, for example, your husband had helped bake the cake and then overvalued it because of his contribution. 

Since the situation revolves around your effort and your husband’s lack of engagement with the result—not his overvaluation of his own contribution—this is not an instance of the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"This example does **not** appear to be an instance of the **IKEA Effect**. The IKEA Effect refers to the cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created or assembled themselves (e.g., furniture they built, crafts they made). The key aspect of the IKEA Effect is that the **creator** overvalues their own work because of the effort they put into it. 

In this case, the sister is the one creating the paintings and presumably values them (hence her insistence on gifting them), but the issue described is about the **recipients** (the husband and wife) not valuing the handmade gifts because they are poorly made and unwanted. The frustration stems from a mismatch in gift-giving expectations and perceived fairness, not from the sister overvaluing her own creations due to her labor (though she might—that just isn't the focus here). 

The core of the problem is the lack of reciprocity and the sister's disregard for the recipients' preferences, not a psychological bias in her own valuation of the paintings.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"(Trow away since some people I know in RL know my account)

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"The example you provided does **not** clearly illustrate the **IKEA Effect**, though there are some tangential connections. Here’s why:

The **IKEA Effect** refers to the cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created or assembled themselves (e.g., IKEA furniture they built). This bias is rooted in the effort put into the creation, leading the creator to overvalue the outcome. Importantly, the effect typically applies to the **creator's own perception** of the item's worth, not necessarily the recipient's.

In your example:
1. Your sister-in-law (the creator) likely values her DIY gifts highly due to the effort and personalization she invested (consistent with the IKEA Effect for **her**). 
2. However, **you** (the recipient) do not value them, which is not a direct reflection of the IKEA Effect. Your dislike stems from mismatched preferences, not an overvaluation due to your own labor. 
3. The conflict arises from a clash of perspectives: your SIL’s pride in her creations vs. your practical dissatisfaction. The IKEA Effect isn’t about the recipient’s reaction but the creator’s attachment.

The IKEA Effect might explain why your SIL and her family defend the gifts (they may overvalue them due to her effort), but your frustration is unrelated to the bias. Your stance is about utility and taste, not an undervaluation of labor you didn’t perform.

Thus, this scenario isn’t a clear instance of the IKEA Effect in action.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

So reddit, AITA for calling her overbearing? I've been trying to work on independency with my mother lately, but i might have been too rough.",0,"The IKEA Effect refers to the cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created or assembled themselves. This bias occurs because the effort invested in the creation or assembly of the product leads to a sense of pride and ownership, making the product more valuable to the individual than it objectively is. 

In the example you provided, there is no mention of you or anyone else assembling, creating, or customizing a product. Instead, the situation revolves around your mother's controlling behavior, your desire for independence, and the conflict arising from your choice to switch phones to avoid being tracked. The focus is on autonomy, boundaries, and familial tension, not on the valuation of a self-assembled or self-created product. 

Therefore, this is not an instance of the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the example given is an instance of the IKEA Effect. First, I need to recall what the IKEA Effect is. From what I remember, the IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created or assembled themselves. The idea is that when you put effort into creating something, you value it more than if someone else made it, even if the end result isn't perfect.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person built a custom cabinet as an attic access door. They spent 60 hours on it, went above and beyond the basic requirement (like just using plywood), and didn't charge extra. They added a mailbox lock for functionality, even though it's not visually great. The designer and client are upset about the lock and want it changed. The person feels frustrated because their effort is being dismissed over this detail.

So, the key elements here are the effort invested in creating the cabinet and the creator's attachment to it despite criticism. The IKEA Effect would be the creator overvaluing their own creation because they put a lot of work into it. But wait, the IKEA Effect usually refers to the creator's own valuation. In this case, the creator (the contractor) feels their work is underappreciated. But the effect is about the creator valuing their own work more. The client and designer don't like part of it, but the contractor is upset because they invested time and effort. So the contractor's frustration might stem from their own overvaluation of the cabinet (including the lock) because they built it. They might think it's better or more acceptable than others do, even if the lock isn't ideal. That would align with the IKEA Effect. The contractor's attachment due to their effort leads them to value the cabinet more than others do, hence the frustration when the lock is criticized. 

But wait, another angle: the IKEA Effect typically applies when people assemble or create something themselves and then value it higher. Here, the contractor is the one who built it, not the client. The client hasn't built it, so their criticism isn't related to the IKEA Effect. The effect here would be if the client had built it and then loved it despite flaws. But in this case, the contractor built it and is attached to it. So maybe the contractor is experiencing the IKEA Effect because they overvalue their own creation due to the effort they put in. Even though the lock is functional but not attractive, the contractor thinks it's acceptable because they made it, but the client doesn't. So the contractor's frustration comes from their own overvaluation (due to effort) leading them to dismiss the client's valid criticism. That would fit the IKEA Effect. 

Alternatively, if the effect is about the end-user (client) overvaluing their own contributions, then this example wouldn't fit. But the contractor's own overvaluation because of their effort would be an instance. So yes, this seems to be an example of the IKEA Effect. The contractor's significant effort leads them to value the cabinet more, even when others point out flaws. They can't see the flaw (the lock) as a big issue because they're attached to their own creation.
</think>

The example provided does align with the IKEA Effect, which describes the tendency for individuals to overvalue a product or outcome they have personally contributed effort to creating, even if the result is imperfect. In this case, the contractor invested significant time (60 hours) and creativity into designing a custom cabinet, going beyond basic requirements. Their frustration at the client’s criticism of the mailbox lock—a functional but aesthetically lacking detail—stems from their emotional attachment to the work they put in. The contractor’s perception of the cabinet’s value is heightened by their own labor and dedication, leading them to downplay the lock’s shortcomings and feel personally dismissed. This reflects the core of the IKEA Effect: the creator’s overvaluation of their own effortful creation, even when external parties perceive flaws.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I hate it when I’m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like “I wasn’t paying attention”. It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.
I love watching movies. I know it’s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it’s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it. I know that not everyone I met will feel about it the way I do but I still would like to be able to talk about it without feeling like I’m forcing the other person to talk with me. I’m not sure if there’s something I’m doing wrong but I don’t act that way when they talk about something I don’t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don’t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I’m saying as if it doesn’t matter. And like I said it’s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don’t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out. I know that they probably aren’t doing it on purpose and that they probably think I just look at it like it’s a joke but sometimes it actually does hurt my feelings a bit. I wish I didn’t care this much but it’s hard not to.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the given example is an instance of the IKEA Effect. Hmm. First, I need to recall what the IKEA Effect actually is. From what I remember, the IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on things they've partially created or assembled themselves. Like when you build your own furniture from IKEA, you tend to value it more just because you put effort into building it.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person is talking about feeling hurt when others don't pay attention to their passionate discussions about movies. They put a lot of effort into explaining and sharing their excitement, but others zone out. They feel unappreciated and wish someone would engage with them as much as they do with others.

Wait, the IKEA Effect is about valuing self-made things more. The example here is about emotional investment in conversations and wanting reciprocal attention. The person feels their effort in communication isn't being matched. But the IKEA Effect is about the creator's own overvaluation of their creation. So maybe not directly related. Unless the effort they put into explaining their interests is seen as a 'creation' they value more. But the key aspect of the IKEA Effect is the creation of a product or tangible item. The example here is about social interaction and emotional effort, not creating something. 

Alternatively, maybe if the person created the movie content themselves, but they're just a fan. They're not creators, just enthusiasts. So their effort is in the conversation, not in creating the movies. The IKEA Effect doesn't apply here. The person's frustration is more about reciprocity in communication and feeling undervalued, not about overvaluing their own creations. 

So I think the answer is no. The example isn't an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect involves increased valuation due to personal labor in creation, not emotional investment in a topic or conversation.
</think>

ANSWER: No

The IKEA Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals place a disproportionately high value on products, tasks, or ideas they have personally contributed to creating, assembling, or investing effort into. This phenomenon is tied to the sense of ownership and pride derived from one's labor, such as building IKEA furniture, crafting a project, or even generating ideas. 

In the example provided, the frustration stems from a mismatch in conversational investment and reciprocity. The speaker feels hurt when others do not engage with their passion (e.g., movies) to the same degree they engage with others' interests. While there is emotional effort and personal investment in sharing their enthusiasm, this does not align with the core mechanism of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect specifically involves overvaluing one's own *creations* or *contributions* (e.g., something they built, designed, or materially shaped). Here, the focus is on social validation, attention, and mutual respect in communication, rather than an inflated valuation of a self-made or self-assembled product or idea. The speaker's distress arises from unmet expectations of reciprocity, not from overvaluing their own labor in creating something tangible or conceptual.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the situation described is an example of the IKEA Effect. First, I need to remember what the IKEA Effect actually is. From what I recall, the IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on products they partially created or assembled themselves. So, when someone puts effort into making something, they tend to value it more than if someone else made it.

Now, looking at the example given. The wife made a Tres Leches cake for her husband's friends. She put in a lot of effort, working on it after her job on Friday. However, her husband hasn't tried any of the cake, even though he's eating other things she made, like snickerdoodle cookies. She's upset because he hasn't even taken a bite, which makes her feel unappreciated. 

The question is whether this scenario is an instance of the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect would typically involve the creator (in this case, the wife) valuing the cake more because she made it. But here, the issue isn't about her overvaluing her own creation; she's upset that her husband doesn't value it. The husband isn't the one who made the cake, so his lack of interest doesn't directly relate to the IKEA Effect. The effect is about the creator's increased valuation, not others' undervaluation. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If the husband had assembled the cake and then valued it more, that would be the IKEA Effect. But here, the wife is the one who made it, and her frustration stems from her husband not appreciating her effort. The IKEA Effect doesn't explain someone else's lack of appreciation. Instead, this might be more about effort justification or feeling unappreciated, but not the IKEA Effect itself. 

So, the answer would be no. The IKEA Effect isn't demonstrated here because the effect pertains to the creator's overvaluation, not the recipient's underappreciation.
</think>

The IKEA Effect refers to a psychological phenomenon where individuals place a disproportionately high value on products or outcomes they have personally contributed to creating, even if the end result is imperfect or of lower quality. This bias arises from the effort invested, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in the creation. In the example provided, the wife invested significant effort into baking the Tres Leches cake, which likely heightened her attachment to it. However, the core issue here revolves around her husband’s lack of engagement with the cake, not her own overvaluation of it. The IKEA Effect specifically explains why the *creator* (the wife) might value the cake more due to her labor, but it does not address why a third party (the husband) might undervalue or disregard it. The husband’s behavior could stem from unrelated factors (e.g., personal preferences, lack of interest in cake, or oversight), but his actions do not exemplify the IKEA Effect, as he did not participate in the cake’s creation. The wife’s disappointment stems from feeling unappreciated, which relates more to emotional labor or mismatched expectations rather than the cognitive bias tied to self-made creations.

Like when you build your own furniture from IKEA, you tend to value it more just because you put effort into making it.

Now, looking at the example given here. The user is talking about a family conflict during vacation planning. The dad gets upset when the user suggests renting a lakehouse or Airbnb instead of a hotel. The dad insults the user and their spouse, calling them fat and lazy. The argument escalates, and the user feels hurt and overwhelmed.

Hmm. The IKEA Effect is about valuing self-made things more. But this situation seems more about interpersonal conflict, criticism, and maybe issues of respect or communication. The user's dad is attacking their choices and personal attributes, not something related to creating or building something. The user's suggestion of a lakehouse might involve some effort (like cooking breakfast themselves), which the dad opposes because he doesn't want to deal with that. But the conflict here isn't about the dad valuing something he helped create; it's about him wanting others to handle tasks (like breakfast) and lashing out with insults.

Wait, maybe the user's dad doesn't want to put effort into making breakfast, which is why he prefers a hotel where breakfast is provided. But the IKEA Effect would involve someone valuing their own contributions more. If the dad was insisting on building something themselves and then valuing it more, that would fit. But in this case, the dad is avoiding effort (not wanting to worry about breakfast) and criticizing others. That seems opposite. The user's suggestion of a rental might require more involvement (like cooking), which the dad resists. So the dad's resistance isn't about overvaluing his own work but rather not wanting additional responsibilities.

So the key elements of the IKEA Effect don't seem present here. The conflict is about personal attacks and differing preferences for vacation logistics, not about placing higher value on self-made efforts. Therefore, this example doesn't illustrate the IKEA Effect.
</think>

The IKEA Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals place disproportionately high value on products, outcomes, or ideas they have personally contributed to creating or assembling, often due to the effort they invested. This phenomenon hinges on the psychological link between labor and valuation—people tend to overvalue their own contributions or creations, even if the end result is imperfect or objectively comparable to alternatives.

In the scenario described, the conflict revolves around interpersonal criticism, communication breakdowns, and differing preferences for vacation logistics. The user suggests renting a lakehouse or Airbnb, which the father opposes, citing a desire to avoid responsibilities like preparing breakfast and resorting to derogatory remarks about the user and their spouse. The father’s objections stem from his aversion to effort (e.g., cooking) and his judgmental attitude, not from an overvaluation of something he personally contributed to building or designing. The argument centers on personal attacks, defensiveness, and clashing expectations, rather than any heightened valuation of self-made efforts or collaborative creations.

The IKEA Effect would apply if, for example, the family had collectively planned or built a vacation itinerary themselves and then insisted it was superior to pre-packaged options *because* of their direct involvement. Here, there is no indication that the father or others are overvaluing their own contributions to a shared project. Instead, the tension arises from criticism, resistance to effort, and interpersonal friction, which are unrelated to the core mechanism of the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the IKEA Effect. Hmm. I need to remember what the IKEA Effect actually is. From what I recall, the IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on things they've partially created or assembled themselves. Like when you build furniture from IKEA, you value it more just because you put effort into making it. So it's about overvaluing your own creations, even if they're not that great.

Now, looking at the example. The sister-in-law makes these handmade paintings that the person thinks are terrible. She keeps giving them as gifts despite the recipients not wanting them. The IKEA Effect would come into play if the sister-in-law values her own paintings more highly because she made them herself. She might think they're better or more meaningful gifts than they actually are, just because she put effort into creating them. 

But wait, the IKEA Effect is about the creator's own valuation of their work. In this case, the problem is that the sister-in-law is giving these gifts, but the recipients don't like them. The sister might be overvaluing her own work (due to her effort), leading her to believe they are good gifts. If that's the case, then yes, this is an example of the IKEA Effect. The sister's effort in making the paintings makes her think they're more valuable than others do. 

But I should check if there's any other aspect. The IKEA Effect is specifically about the creator's increased valuation. The recipients here don't value the items, but the giver does. So the sister's insistence on giving these gifts despite the recipients' lack of appreciation could be because she overvalues her own creations. That fits the IKEA Effect. 

Alternatively, if she's giving them because she's cheap or doesn't want to spend money, that's a different issue. But the user mentioned that the sister and her husband spend a lot on themselves, so maybe she's not being cheap. She might genuinely believe her paintings are good gifts. That would align with the IKEA Effect. 

So the answer would be yes, this is an instance of the IKEA Effect because the sister-in-law overvalues her handmade gifts due to the effort she put into creating them, even though others don't find them valuable.
</think>

The IKEA Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals place a disproportionately high value on products or creations they have personally contributed effort to, even if the end result is of low quality. In this scenario, the sister-in-law consistently gives handmade paintings as gifts, despite their poor quality and the recipients’ clear lack of appreciation. Her insistence on continuing this practice—even when the recipients provide specific wishlists or hints—suggests she overvalues her own creations due to the effort she invests in making them. This aligns with the IKEA Effect: her labor leads her to perceive the paintings as more meaningful or valuable than others do, justifying her choice to gift them repeatedly. While the recipients view the paintings as unwanted and low-quality, the sister-in-law’s attachment to her work (rooted in her own effort) likely drives her belief that they are appropriate gifts. Her behavior reflects the core idea of the IKEA Effect, where personal effort inflates perceived value, even when external validation is absent.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"(Trow away since some people I know in RL know my account)

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of the IKEA Effect. First, I need to recall what the IKEA Effect actually is. From what I remember, the IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on things they partially created themselves. So, when someone puts effort into building or creating something, they tend to value it more than if it were made by someone else.

Now, looking at the example. The sister-in-law (SIL) makes DIY gifts for Christmas. The recipient (the person telling the story) doesn't like the gifts because they're not to their taste or useful (like the ornaments, cream liqueur, tote bag). However, the SIL and the family think these are thoughtful gifts. The person's wife got upset when they called the gifts ""DIYed shit,"" indicating that the family values these homemade items more than the recipient does.

The key here is who is experiencing the increased valuation. The IKEA Effect typically affects the creator, making them value their own creation more. But in this case, the SIL is the one who made the gifts, so she might value them higher because of her effort. The family members who appreciate the gifts might also be influenced by the effort the SIL put in, even though they didn't make the gifts themselves. Wait, but the IKEA Effect is about the creator's own valuation. However, sometimes when people know about the effort someone else put in, they might appreciate it more, but that's maybe a different concept, like the labor illusion or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the family members (including the wife) are exhibiting the IKEA Effect because they're part of the same family and perhaps contributed to the gifts in some way? Or maybe they're just valuing the effort more because they understand the work involved, even if they didn't make it themselves. But the core of the IKEA Effect is about the creator's own overvaluation. So if the SIL values her own gifts more because she made them, that's the IKEA Effect. The family's appreciation might be more about sentimental value or effort recognition rather than the IKEA Effect. The person receiving the gifts doesn't value them because they didn't participate in creating them. 

So in this scenario, the SIL, as the creator, might overvalue her DIY gifts (IKEA Effect), leading her to think they're great, while the recipient doesn't. The family's positive reaction could be due to understanding the effort (labor illusion) or shared family values. The conflict arises because the creator's high valuation (due to IKEA Effect) clashes with the recipient's lower valuation. Therefore, the example does involve the IKEA Effect on the part of the SIL, even though the main story is told from the recipient's perspective. The question is whether the scenario is an instance of the IKEA Effect. Since the effect is about the creator valuing their own work more, and the SIL's behavior aligns with that (she and her family think the gifts are great because she made them), then yes, this is an example of the IKEA Effect.
</think>

The IKEA Effect refers to the cognitive bias where individuals place a higher value on products they have partially or fully created themselves, due to the effort and labor they invested. In this scenario, the sister-in-law (SIL) is the creator of the DIY gifts, and her family (including the wife) perceives these gifts as ""thoughtful"" and valuable, likely because they recognize the effort SIL put into making them. The SIL herself may also overvalue her creations due to her personal investment in crafting them, which aligns with the IKEA Effect. However, the recipient (the narrator) does not value the gifts highly because they did not participate in creating them and finds the items impractical or unappealing. 

The conflict arises because the SIL and her family, influenced by the effort and labor involved in the gifts, judge them as inherently valuable (consistent with the IKEA Effect), while the recipient, lacking that personal investment, does not share this valuation. The IKEA Effect here primarily applies to the SIL and her family’s perspective, as their appreciation stems from the creator’s effort. The narrator’s dissatisfaction, on the other hand, highlights the disconnect between the creator’s overvaluation and the recipient’s subjective experience.

IKEA Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

So reddit, AITA for calling her overbearing? I've been trying to work on independency with my mother lately, but i might have been too rough.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example given is an instance of the IKEA Effect. First, I need to remember what the IKEA Effect actually is. From what I recall, the IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on products they partially created or assembled themselves. The idea is that the effort someone puts into building something leads them to overvalue it. Like when you put together IKEA furniture, you might think it's better just because you built it.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person is an adult living on their own, dealing with an overbearing mother who tracks their phone. They bought a new phone (Android) which makes tracking harder, leading to conflict with the mother. The mother is upset about losing the ability to track them, leading to arguments and accusations.

Hmm. The key elements here are the mother's need for control, the user's desire for independence, and the conflict arising from the phone tracking. The IKEA Effect involves valuing something more because of one's own effort in creating it. But in this scenario, the user is switching phones to avoid being tracked. The mother's attachment to tracking might be about control rather than any effort she put into the phone. The user's action is about asserting independence, not about valuing something they built.

Wait, maybe the mother's insistence on tracking could be related to her investment in monitoring? Like, if she put effort into tracking (like setting it up, checking it often), does that make her value the tracking more? But the IKEA Effect is about the creator's own valuation. The mother isn't the one who built the phone or the tracking app. She's just using it. The user's choice to switch phones isn't about their own creation either. They just bought a new phone to avoid being monitored.

Alternatively, maybe the user's effort in setting up their own life (working 50 hours, paying bills) leads them to value their independence more. But that's more about self-reliance than the IKEA Effect. The IKEA Effect specifically relates to the act of creating or assembling something. Unless the user's independence is something they 'built' through their efforts, but I think that's stretching the definition. The effect is usually about tangible products or perhaps ideas they've contributed to, not life situations.

So, no, this doesn't seem to fit the IKEA Effect. The conflict here is about control, independence, and family dynamics, not about overvaluing something because of personal effort in its creation.
</think>

The IKEA Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals place a disproportionately high value on products, ideas, or outcomes they have personally contributed to creating, assembling, or customizing. This bias arises from the psychological investment of effort, leading people to overvalue their own creations compared to identical items they did not help produce. For example, someone might value a self-assembled IKEA shelf more than a pre-built one, even if the quality is the same, simply because they invested time and effort into constructing it.

In the scenario described, the conflict centers on the user asserting independence from their mother by switching to a phone that limits tracking. The mother’s anger stems from losing control over monitoring the user’s location, not from any effort she personally invested in creating or customizing the phone or tracking system. Similarly, the user’s decision to switch phones is motivated by a desire for autonomy and reduced anxiety, not by an increased valuation of the new phone due to personal effort in its creation. The tension here revolves around boundaries, control, and family dynamics rather than the psychological ownership or overvaluation tied to effortful creation.

Since the IKEA Effect specifically involves valuing something more because of one’s own labor or contribution to its creation—and no such effort or creation is present in this scenario—the example does not align with the concept.

IKEA Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0,"The IKEA Effect is a phenomenon where people place a higher value on products or projects they have put effort into, even if the end result is not significantly better than a similar product or project that required less effort.

Your frustration and the value you place on your work, despite the client's and interior designer's concerns, are indicative of the IKEA Effect.

This effect is named after IKEA, the furniture retailer, because customers often feel a sense of pride and satisfaction in assembling their own furniture, which can lead to a higher perceived value of the product.

In the scenario you described, it seems that you have invested a significant amount of time and effort into making the Tres Leches cake for your husband and his friends. However, your husband has not shown much interest in trying the cake, despite your hard work. This situation may be related to the IKEA Effect, as you may be placing a higher value on the cake due to the effort you put into making it, while your husband may not be as invested in it.

However, it's important to note that the IKEA Effect is not the only possible explanation for your husband's behavior. There could be other reasons why he hasn't tried the cake, such as a lack of appetite or a preference for other types of desserts. It's also possible that he is simply not aware of how much effort you put into making the cake.

In any case, it's important to communicate with your husband about your feelings and to try to understand his perspective. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your expectations and to find a solution that works for both of you.

IKEA Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)

IKEA Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

So reddit, AITA for calling her overbearing? I've been trying to work on independency with my mother lately, but i might have been too rough.",0,"The IKEA Effect is a phenomenon in behavioral economics where people place a disproportionately high value on products they have invested time, effort, or energy into, even if the actual monetary value of the product is low. This effect is named after the IKEA furniture company, as customers often assemble their own furniture, which can lead them to value the finished product more highly than its actual market value.

In the situation described, the mother's reaction to the new phone and the inability to track the individual's location does not directly relate to the IKEA Effect. The mother's behavior appears to be more about control and the desire to monitor the individual's whereabouts, rather than an emotional attachment to something she has invested in. The focus is on the mother's emotional response to losing the ability to track the individual, not on any investment she has made in a product.

Therefore, the example provided does not seem to be an instance of the IKEA Effect.

All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes.

",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to the tendency for individuals to prefer a known, unfavorable situation over an unknown, potentially better situation, due to the fear of uncertainty and the potential risks associated with change. This phenomenon is often observed in situations where people are hesitant to leave a bad relationship, job, or other unfavorable circumstance, despite being unhappy, because they are uncertain about what the future holds and fear that things might get worse.

In the given example, the woman is describing a marriage that has become unfulfilling and feels more like a roommate situation. She is shouldering all the responsibilities, including financial, household chores, and taking care of the animals, while her husband is not contributing equally. The lack of intimacy and emotional connection has also taken a toll on her self-esteem and feelings of attractiveness. Despite feeling unhappy and unfulfilled in the marriage, she is hesitant to leave due to the fear of the unknown, specifically the uncertainty of what her life would be like after leaving the marriage.

This hesitation to leave the marriage, despite being unhappy, is a classic example of the Pseudocertainty Effect. The woman is preferring the known, unfavorable situation (the unfulfilling marriage) over the unknown, potentially better situation (leaving the marriage and starting anew), due to the fear of uncertainty and the potential risks associated with change. She is scared of taking the leap and leaving the marriage, even though she is unhappy, because she is uncertain about what the future holds and fears that things might get worse.

Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a cognitive bias where people tend to be overconfident in their judgments or decisions when they have some, but not complete, information. This phenomenon is often observed in situations where individuals have access to partial or incomplete data, leading them to feel more certain about their conclusions than they should be.

In the given example, the individual is upset about a delivery person who allegedly did not make an effort to deliver their order. The customer claims that the delivery person made ""zero effort"" and decides to report them to Amazon. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the customer's judgment may be based on limited information. They saw the delivery person biking away and took a photo, but they do not have complete knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the failed delivery.

The customer's anger and decision to report the delivery person may be influenced by the Pseudocertainty Effect. They have some information (the delivery person biking away) that leads them to believe the delivery person was lazy, but they do not have all the facts. There could be various reasons why the delivery person was unable to complete the delivery, such as issues with access, incorrect address, or other unforeseen circumstances.

The customer's overconfidence in their judgment is evident in their strong emotional response and decision to report the delivery person. They are ""absolutely furious"" and ""still seething"" after the incident, which suggests that they are highly confident in their assessment of the situation. However, this confidence may be misplaced, as they do not have complete information about the delivery person's actions or intentions.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that the customer's behavior and decision-making may be an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect, as they are making a judgment based on limited information and exhibiting overconfidence in their conclusion.

This effect is often observed in situations where individuals are faced with complex or ambiguous information, and they tend to prefer simplistic or definitive answers, even if they are not entirely accurate.

In the context of the provided example, the Pseudocertainty Effect can be seen in the way the partner uses AI-generated text to express himself. The use of chat GBT to generate a birthday card message creates a sense of certainty and coherence, as the language is polished and well-structured. However, this certainty is pseudo, as the message is not genuinely from the partner, but rather generated by an AI algorithm.

The speaker's reaction to the birthday card is also telling. They are sad and feel that the card is not genuine, not because of the language itself, but because it lacks the personal touch and imperfections that would make it truly heartfelt. This suggests that the speaker values authenticity and sincerity over polished language, and is able to see through the pseudo-certainty created by the AI-generated text.

Furthermore, the partner's motivation for using chat GBT to generate the birthday card message is also relevant to the Pseudocertainty Effect. The partner may have used the AI tool to try to impress the speaker or to make a good impression, rather than taking the time to express himself in his own words. This behavior is driven by a desire to create a sense of certainty and confidence, rather than being genuine and authentic.

In conclusion, the example provided does illustrate the Pseudocertainty Effect, as the partner's use of AI-generated text creates a sense of certainty and coherence that is not entirely genuine. The speaker's reaction to the birthday card also highlights the importance of authenticity and sincerity in communication, and the limitations of relying on pseudo-certain information.

I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

WIBTA?",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the likelihood of a positive outcome due to their overconfidence in their own abilities or the perceived certainty of a particular event. This phenomenon is often observed in situations where people are making decisions under uncertainty, and they tend to downplay or ignore potential risks and negative outcomes.

In the given example, the individual in question is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full-time, despite having a weak and shaky voice, writing clichéd or nonsensical lyrics, and receiving limited attention for his music (only 50-100 views). However, he remains convinced that his lack of success is due to not releasing enough music and not putting in enough time, rather than acknowledging his potential lack of talent.

This behavior exhibits characteristics of the Pseudocertainty Effect, as the individual is overestimating his chances of success in the music industry and downplaying the significant risks associated with abandoning a stable and respected career. His conviction that he can succeed with more practice and harder work, despite the lack of objective evidence supporting his abilities, further reinforces this notion.

Additionally, the fact that he surrounds himself with well-meaning but unhelpful strangers who encourage him to continue pursuing his dreams, rather than seeking constructive feedback or criticism, may also contribute to his overconfidence and distorted perception of reality.

The friends' decision to let him make the mistake by himself, rather than sharing their honest concerns and potentially hurting his feelings, may also be seen as a form of enabling behavior that perpetuates the Pseudocertainty Effect.

Given the information provided, it appears that the individual's decision-making process is influenced by an overestimation of his abilities and a distorted perception of the likelihood of success, which are key characteristics of the Pseudocertainty Effect.

Pseudocertainty Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.

AITA?",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a phenomenon where people tend to overestimate the accuracy of their predictions or the certainty of their knowledge, especially when faced with uncertain or ambiguous situations. This effect can lead individuals to make hasty judgments or react impulsively, as they may feel more confident in their assessments than is warranted.

In the context of the provided example, the husband's reaction to learning about his wife's past relationship with Dan can be seen as an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Upon discovering this new information, the husband immediately jumped to conclusions about his wife's character and their relationship, feeling betrayed and questioning his trust in her. He seemed to assume that his wife's failure to disclose this information earlier was a sign of deception or dishonesty, rather than considering alternative explanations, such as her not seeing it as relevant to their current relationship.

The husband's overconfidence in his assessment of the situation led him to react impulsively and aggressively, lashing out at his wife in front of their family and friends. This reaction was likely driven by his perceived sense of certainty about the situation, which was not necessarily justified by the facts. In reality, the wife's past relationship with Dan was a relatively innocuous aspect of her history, and her decision not to disclose it earlier did not necessarily imply any malicious intent.

The husband's subsequent feelings of guilt and attempts to apologize suggest that he may have realized his overreaction was unwarranted, and that his initial assessment of the situation was not as certain as he had thought. This recognition of uncertainty and the need to revisit his initial judgment is a key aspect of the Pseudocertainty Effect.

WIBTA?",0,"The scenario you’ve described involves a person abandoning a traditional, stable career path to pursue a passion in singing, despite having limited success and skills in that area. In this situation, the pseudocertainty effect isn't directly applicable.

The pseudocertainty effect is a cognitive bias wherein people make decisions based on the perceived certainty of outcomes, often overweighting guaranteed outcomes over probabilistic ones when faced with complex or multi-stage choices. It often occurs when individuals are guided by a desire to avoid sure losses and strongly prefer sure gains, even if the probabilistic alternative might have a higher expected value.

In this scenario, the individual is not exactly choosing between a certain and an uncertain outcome in the domains typically discussed under the pseudocertainty effect. Instead, he is motivated by a personal aspiration (pursuing music) and is apparently overconfident about his ability to succeed in it, despite a low probability of success indicated by his past experiences (limited views and poor feedback). His decision seems more influenced by overconfidence bias, a passion-driven commitment, or possibly even an escalation of commitment, rather than a cognitive bias about certainty versus uncertainty.

For this reason, the example described does not fit into how the pseudocertainty effect typically functions, as it largely involves decision-making where outcomes are simplified through certainty under multi-stage conditions, a scenario not apparent in the described story about pursuing singing.

Pseudocertainty Effect,gpt-4o,"(Trow away since some people I know in RL know my account)

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect is a cognitive bias in which people make risk-averse choices when outcomes are perceived as certain, and more risk-seeking choices when outcomes are perceived as uncertain. This effect often involves changes in decision-making behavior based on how choices are presented, particularly in a two-stage decision-making scenario where the certainty of outcomes is manipulated.

In the scenario you provided, the focus is on your personal dislike of the handcrafted, DIY gifts you receive from your sister-in-law. The situation involves interpersonal dynamics and preferences regarding gift-giving. Your reaction is based on personal taste and the perceived value or usability of the gifts, rather than the certainty or uncertainty of any outcomes or decisions. The complaint is more about the expectation of what a gift should be rather than any manipulation or presentation of risk or certainty.

Therefore, this scenario does not involve decision-making under conditions of risk or uncertainty nor is it about how those conditions are framed. It is more about personal preferences and interpersonal relationships rather than a behavioral economic principle such as the Pseudocertainty Effect.

Pseudocertainty Effect,gpt-4o,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?",0,"The situation described in your example is not an instance of the pseudocertainty effect. The pseudocertainty effect is a cognitive bias related to decision-making, particularly under conditions of uncertainty. It refers to the tendency of people to perceive outcomes as certain when in fact they are uncertain. This often occurs in multi-stage decision problems where individuals assume certainty in later stages based on the outcomes they received earlier, even if those outcomes do not provide certainty.

In your example, the situation revolves around relationship dynamics, communication, and emotional reactions rather than decision-making under conditions of uncertainty or multi-stage decisions. The issue is about trust, disclosure of past relationships, and the emotional response of a partner when confronted with unexpected information. It involves interpersonal conflict and emotions rather than cognitive biases in decision-making processes.

The pseudocertainty effect would typically involve scenarios where individuals might evaluate risks or choices differently based on presumed certainties in a sequence of decisions, not the emotional and relational dynamics presented in this scenario.

Pseudocertainty Effect,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

",0," ANSWER: Yes

The example provided illustrates the Pseudocertainty Effect, a psychological phenomenon where individuals stay in a situation (in this case, a marriage) because they fear the unknown of leaving, even when the current situation is clearly unsatisfactory and unbalanced. The individual in the example feels more like a roommate than a partner, shouldering most of the household responsibilities, financial burdens, and even experiencing a lack of intimacy. Despite the obvious issues, the fear of the unknown and potential instability of leaving the marriage keeps her from taking action, leading to a sense of pseudocertainty about her current situation.",,yes,

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. This psychological phenomenon occurs when people believe that using technology or pre-written messages can make their communication seem more certain, eloquent, or impressive. In this case, your partner used AI-generated text to create a birthday card for you, hoping it would appear more polished and heartfelt. However, the use of AI in this context created a sense of inauthenticity, as you felt that the card lacked the personal touch and genuine emotion that comes from a message written by the sender themselves. This is a classic example of the Pseudocertainty Effect, where the use of technology to create a message can backfire and lead to feelings of dissatisfaction or disappointment.",,no,

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

The example you provided does seem to be an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a situation where a person overestimates the likelihood that others will share their preferences or opinions, leading to a sense of certainty about others' reactions. In this case, your sister-in-law (SIL) seems to have overestimated the likelihood that everyone in her family would appreciate the DIY gifts she made, and became offended when you expressed dislike for them. This overestimation of shared preferences is a key aspect of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Additionally, the fact that you felt the need to drop a comment about not wanting more DIY gifts suggests that you had a sense of certainty about your preferences and the likelihood that others would share them, which is another characteristic of the Pseudocertainty Effect.",,no,
Pseudocertainty Effect,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.

AITA?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The situation described in the example appears to be an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. This phenomenon occurs when individuals make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information, leading to incorrect assumptions and negative outcomes.

In this case, the wife withheld information about her past relationship with Dan from her husband, assuming that it was not relevant to their current relationship. However, when her husband learned about this past relationship at the party, he felt betrayed and insecure, leading to a heated argument and a breakdown in trust.

The wife's assumption that her husband would not care about her past relationship with Dan was based on pseudocertainty, or a belief that she knew how he would react without having all the necessary information. This pseudocertainty led to a miscommunication and a negative outcome in the relationship.

To avoid the pseudocertainty effect in the future, the wife could have communicated more openly with her husband about her past relationships and discussed any potential triggers or concerns that might arise in social situations. By doing so, she could have avoided the misunderstanding and the negative consequences that resulted from the party.",,no,

",0,"The **Pseudocertainty Effect** is a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain or nearly certain when it is actually uncertain, often because they overweigh the familiarity or comfort of the current situation compared to the uncertainty of change. In your case, you describe feeling trapped in a marriage where your needs are unmet, yet you hesitate to leave due to fear of the unknown. This aligns with the Pseudocertainty Effect because:

1. **Perceived Certainty of the Status Quo**: You describe the current situation as deeply unsatisfying, yet you stay because it feels ""certain"" or familiar, even though it is emotionally harmful. The discomfort of the known (your unhappy marriage) feels safer than the uncertainty of leaving (potential loneliness, financial changes, etc.).

2. **Overweighting the Familiar**: You acknowledge that you’ve been ""too scared of the unknown"" to leave, which suggests you’re assigning disproportionate weight to the (negative) certainty of your current situation compared to the (potentially positive but uncertain) outcomes of leaving.

3. **Avoidance of Ambiguity**: The Pseudocertainty Effect often involves avoiding ambiguous or unpredictable futures, even when the current situation is objectively worse. Your fear of the unknown keeps you in a stagnant relationship, despite clear evidence that it’s not working.

Thus, your hesitation to leave due to fear of the unknown, while enduring a clearly unfulfilling marriage, is an example of the Pseudocertainty Effect. You’re treating the current situation as ""certain"" (even though it’s harmful) and overestimating the risks of change (which are uncertain but could be better).

The Pseudocertainty Effect occurs when people perceive an outcome as certain or highly likely due to the way information is presented, even when it is actually uncertain or probabilistic. This often involves overestimating the likelihood of a negative or positive outcome based on emotional reactions or framing, rather than objective evidence.

In the given example:
1. The individual received a message stating their order ""couldn’t be delivered,"" which triggered anger.
2. They immediately assumed the delivery person was ""lazy"" and made ""zero effort,"" despite lacking clear evidence (e.g., the photo didn’t show the person’s face or context for their actions).
3. The emotional reaction (fury, seething) led them to report the delivery person quickly, treating their assumption as a certainty (""there was zero effort"").

This behavior aligns with the Pseudocertainty Effect because:
- The individual interpreted an ambiguous situation (failed delivery) as definitively caused by the delivery person’s laziness, ignoring other possible explanations (e.g., incorrect address, bike malfunction, time constraints).
- The emotional response created a false sense of certainty about the delivery person’s intentions or actions, leading to a hasty decision (reporting them).

The Pseudocertainty Effect is evident here because the person’s anger and the framing of the situation (""lazy,"" ""zero effort"") made them treat their assumption as a near-certainty, despite the lack of concrete evidence.

Here’s why:

The **Pseudocertainty Effect** refers to a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain or more likely when it is presented as a sure thing in a specific context, even though it is actually probabilistic. This often occurs in decision-making under risk, where framing (e.g., ""guaranteed"" vs. ""probable"") influences perceived certainty. For example, someone might prefer a ""guaranteed small reward"" over a ""probable larger reward"" because the certainty is overvalued, even if the expected values are similar.

In your example, the issue revolves around **authenticity, effort, and emotional expression**, not probabilistic reasoning or perceived certainty. Your partner’s use of AI to generate a heartfelt message might reflect:
- A desire to meet perceived expectations (e.g., ""sounding poetic"" like you).
- Avoiding insecurity about his own verbal skills.
- Misjudging what you would value (polished words vs. genuine effort).

These are more related to **miscommunication, effort heuristic**, or **social expectations** rather than the Pseudocertainty Effect. There’s no element of probabilistic outcomes or framing of certainty at play here.

WIBTA?",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of the **Pseudocertainty Effect**, let's first define the concept and then analyze the scenario.

### What is the Pseudocertainty Effect?
The **Pseudocertainty Effect** is a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain or nearly certain when it is actually uncertain or probabilistic. This occurs when decisions are framed in a way that makes the risks or probabilities seem more certain than they are, leading to overconfidence in the expected outcome. It often involves ignoring the true uncertainty of a situation because of how the options are presented or perceived.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
1. **Perceived Certainty vs. Actual Uncertainty**: The friend in question believes that his lack of success in music (e.g., low views on songs) is solely due to not dedicating enough time to it. He interprets the situation as though success is *certain* if he just commits fully (""if I work harder and release more, I will succeed""). However, the actual probability of success in the music industry is highly uncertain and influenced by factors beyond effort (e.g., talent, luck, market trends).  
   - He is treating a highly uncertain outcome (musical success) as if it is a near-certainty if he just takes the leap. This aligns with the Pseudocertainty Effect.

2. **Ignoring Base Rates**: The friend disregards objective evidence (his poor singing ability, cliché lyrics, lack of traction despite efforts) and instead focuses on a few encouraging but unrepresentative comments (e.g., strangers saying ""keep going""). This selective attention creates a false sense of certainty about his eventual success.

3. **Framing of the Decision**: He frames quitting his job and dropping out as the ""big step"" that will lead to success, as if the act of committing full-time is the only missing piece. This overlooks the inherent uncertainty and competition in the music industry.

4. **Family Reinforcement**: His family's unconditional support (despite his lack of talent) may further reinforce his pseudocertainty by making the path seem more viable than it objectively is.

### Conclusion:
The friend is exhibiting the **Pseudocertainty Effect** by treating his potential success in music as a near-certain outcome if he just commits fully, while ignoring the high uncertainty and low probability of actual success given his demonstrated lack of talent and market response.

The **Pseudocertainty Effect** is a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain or nearly certain when it is actually probabilistic, often due to the way choices are framed. For example, people might overestimate the likelihood of a positive outcome if an option is presented as ""90% chance of success"" rather than ""10% chance of failure,"" even though they are mathematically equivalent. This effect is typically studied in decision-making contexts involving risk, uncertainty, or probabilistic outcomes (e.g., gambling, medical treatments, or financial choices).

Your situation, however, revolves around **gift preferences, social expectations, and interpersonal conflict**—not probabilistic decision-making or misjudgments of certainty. Your dislike for DIY gifts and your sister-in-law's insistence on giving them is a matter of personal taste and family dynamics, not a cognitive bias involving perceived certainty. 

To summarize:
- The Pseudocertainty Effect involves misjudging probabilities or certainty in decision-making.

Okay, let's try to figure out if the example given is an instance of the pseudocertainty effect. First, I need to remember what the pseudocertainty effect actually is. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain or more likely when it's presented in a way that makes it seem like a sure thing, even if it's actually uncertain. It's related to prospect theory, where people might overweigh certain outcomes when making decisions under risk.

The example here is about a woman in a marriage where she feels more like a roommate than a spouse. She's handling all the responsibilities, finances, and there's a lack of intimacy. She's considering leaving but is scared of the unknown. The question is whether her situation is an example of the pseudocertainty effect.

Hmm. Let me think. The pseudocertainty effect usually involves decision-making where someone treats an uncertain outcome as if it's certain. For example, someone might prefer a sure gain over a probabilistic larger gain, even if the expected value is the same. Or in negative terms, avoiding a sure loss versus a risk of a larger loss.

In the scenario, the woman is stuck between staying in an unhappy marriage and leaving. The pseudocertainty effect would come into play if she's perceiving the outcomes of one choice as more certain than they actually are. Like, maybe she's overestimating the certainty of negative outcomes if she leaves (the unknown) and thus stays, thinking the negative aspects of staying are more certain than they are. Wait, but the pseudocertainty effect often involves framing outcomes as certain when they aren't. Alternatively, she might be staying because she's overvaluing the certainty of her current situation (even though it's bad) compared to the uncertainty of leaving. That sounds like loss aversion, which is related. But pseudocertainty is more about how the options are framed to make an uncertain outcome seem certain.

Alternatively, maybe she's perceiving the continuation of the current situation as a certainty (that things won't get better) and thus feels stuck. But I'm not sure. The key here is whether her decision-making is influenced by a false sense of certainty about the outcomes. For example, if she thinks that leaving will definitely lead to worse outcomes (even though that's uncertain), leading her to stay. Or perhaps she thinks staying is a sure loss (which it might be) versus the uncertain outcome of leaving. But I'm not sure if that's pseudocertainty effect or just regular risk aversion.

Wait, the pseudocertainty effect can also involve people treating multi-stage decisions as if later stages are certain when they're not. For example, in a two-stage game where the first stage has a sure outcome and the second a gamble, people might choose differently based on how the stages are presented. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

In the given example, the main issue is that she's afraid to leave because of the unknown. The fear of the unknown (uncertainty) makes her stay in a bad situation. The pseudocertainty effect might not directly apply here. Alternatively, if she's perceiving the current situation as a certain negative outcome (like, ""I'm definitely unhappy here"") and the alternative as uncertain, but she's choosing the certain unhappiness over the uncertain possibility of improvement. But that's more like risk aversion. The pseudocertainty effect would involve her misjudging probabilities as certain when they aren't. For instance, if she thought that leaving would definitely lead to a better life (a certainty), but in reality, it's uncertain. But in her case, she's not making that assumption; she's scared of the uncertainty of leaving. So maybe it's not pseudocertainty effect but just fear of uncertainty.

Alternatively, if she's staying because she's overconfident that things might get better (certainty of improvement), but that's not the case here. She's staying because she's scared of the unknown, not because she's certain things will get better. So perhaps it's not the pseudocertainty effect. The effect usually involves treating an uncertain outcome as certain. Her situation seems more about preferring a known bad situation over an uncertain one (which is related to loss aversion and status quo bias), not pseudocertainty effect. So maybe the answer is no.
</think>

The pseudocertainty effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals perceive uncertain outcomes as more certain than they actually are, often due to how choices are framed. In the example provided, the individual is grappling with staying in an unhappy marriage versus leaving, fearing the uncertainty of the latter. However, this scenario does not clearly align with the pseudocertainty effect. 

The pseudocertainty effect typically manifests when someone misjudges probabilities, treating a probabilistic outcome as certain (e.g., preferring a ""guaranteed"" small gain over a riskier larger gain, even if the expected values are equivalent). Here, the individual is not misperiving probabilities or reframing uncertainty as certainty. Instead, she is weighing a known negative situation (the current marriage) against an uncertain future (leaving). Her reluctance to leave stems from fear of the unknown, which is more closely related to **risk aversion** or **status quo bias** (preferring the familiar despite its drawbacks) rather than a distortion of probabilistic certainty. 

The pseudocertainty effect would apply if, for instance, she irrationally believed that staying would *definitely* lead to improvement (treating an uncertain outcome as certain) or that leaving would *certainly* result in disaster (overestimating the certainty of negative outcomes). However, her hesitation appears rooted in a rational acknowledgment of uncertainty (""the unknown of leaving"") rather than a cognitive misrepresentation of certainty. Thus, while her decision-making involves psychological biases, it does not exemplify the pseudocertainty effect.

AIO for reporting a lazy delivery person?
I was absolutely furious! I just had to report this person because there was zero effort made on their part. In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot. Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the given example is an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Hmm. First, I need to remember what the Pseudocertainty Effect actually is. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain when it's actually probabilistic, especially when they are presented with a series of stages or events. It's like when people feel more confident in a multi-stage outcome because one stage is presented as certain, even though the overall probability isn't 100%. For example, in decision-making scenarios, if there's a problem that has a 75% chance to pass the first stage and then a 75% chance to pass the second, people might overestimate the total success rate because each stage feels certain in isolation.

Now, looking at the example provided. The user is angry because their order wasn't delivered. They reported a delivery person who they claim made zero effort, providing a photo (but the face isn't visible). They're asking if they overreacted by reporting immediately in anger. 

So, how does this relate to Pseudocertainty Effect? The key here is whether the person's decision to report was influenced by a false sense of certainty about the delivery person's fault. Let's break it down. The user received a message that the order couldn't be delivered. They saw the delivery person biking away and took a photo. But the face isn't visible, so maybe it's not even the right person. The user immediately concluded that the delivery person was lazy and didn't make an effort, leading to the failed delivery. 

The Pseudocertainty Effect would come into play if the user assumed a certain cause (laziness) with high confidence, treating it as a certainty when there might be other possible explanations. For instance, maybe the delivery person had an emergency, or there was an error in the address, or the package was delayed for another reason. But the user jumps to the conclusion that it's definitely the delivery person's fault (certainty) without considering other probabilities. They acted on this perceived certainty, leading to an immediate report. 

Alternatively, maybe the effect isn't exactly fitting here. The Pseudocertainty Effect often involves decision-making under risk where probabilities are involved but presented in a way that makes people think they're certain. For example, in a two-stage problem where the first stage is certain, people might combine probabilities incorrectly. In this scenario, the user isn't facing a probabilistic scenario presented in stages. Instead, they're making an attribution error, perhaps, like the fundamental attribution error (attributing others' actions to character rather than situation). 

Wait, but the Pseudocertainty Effect is about overestimating the certainty of an outcome. If the user is certain that the delivery person's laziness is the cause (when in reality there's uncertainty), then maybe it's related. The user's anger and quick action stem from their belief that the cause is certain (laziness), but there's actually a lot of uncertainty (no face visible, maybe they tried to deliver but couldn't, etc.). 

Another angle: the effect is about how people evaluate choices. For example, choosing between a sure gain and a probabilistic larger gain. But here, the decision is about attributing blame. So maybe it's not the same. Alternatively, the user might be overconfident in their judgment (a form of overconfidence bias) rather than pseudocertainty. 

Hmm. The key distinction is whether the certainty is about a probabilistic outcome presented in stages. Since the example doesn't involve stages or explicit probabilities, perhaps it's not pseudocertainty. The user is making a snap judgment with incomplete information, but that's more akin to jumping to conclusions or attribution bias. 

So, I'm leaning towards this not being an example of the Pseudocertainty Effect. The effect is more about decision-making under risk where probabilities are involved but perceived as certain. The example here is about attribution of blame without considering alternative possibilities, which might be a different bias.
</think>

The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals perceive outcomes as certain (even when they are probabilistic) due to how choices or scenarios are framed, often involving sequential stages where one stage is presented as ""certain."" This effect typically arises in decision-making contexts involving risk, where people misjudge probabilities by treating uncertain outcomes as guaranteed. For example, a person might overestimate the likelihood of success in a multi-stage process if one stage is framed as certain, even if the overall probability remains low.

In the given example, the individual reacts angrily to a failed delivery, immediately attributing the problem to the delivery person's laziness and reporting them. While the person assumes certainty about the delivery person's fault (e.g., ""zero effort made""), this scenario does not clearly align with the Pseudocertainty Effect. The bias here is more likely related to the **fundamental attribution error** (attributing behavior to character rather than situational factors) or **jumping to conclusions** (acting on incomplete evidence). The Pseudocertainty Effect typically involves misjudging probabilities in structured decision-making tasks (e.g., financial risks, multi-stage plans), not snap judgments about others' behavior based on limited information. The individual’s certainty about the delivery person’s guilt stems from emotional reactivity and incomplete data, not a misperception of probabilistic outcomes framed as certain.

Pseudocertainty Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"So my partner has always struggled with words and don’t have a way with words. He’s always said he admired my way with words.

However yesterday when I got my birthday card I could tell most of it was ai generated. There was only one bit at the end that included a line that we say to each other that I knew was him.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example given is an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Hmm, first I need to remember what the Pseudocertainty Effect actually is. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain or more likely when it's presented in a way that reduces apparent uncertainty, even if the actual probability hasn't changed. It's related to decision-making under risk. People might choose options that seem more certain even if they're not statistically better.

In the example, the partner has always struggled with words and used to get help from the narrator for things like resumes and letters. Now, he's using AI to generate a birthday card. The narrator feels sad because the card doesn't feel genuine, even though the partner probably intended to make it better. The partner might have thought using AI would make the message more polished and thus more likely to be appreciated, thinking that a well-written card is a sure way to make the narrator happy. 

Wait, the Pseudocertainty Effect involves overvaluing an outcome that seems certain. So in this case, maybe the partner is using AI because he believes a well-written card (using AI) is a more certain way to express his feelings effectively, compared to his own words which he's insecure about. He might think that the AI-generated message is a safer bet to convey his emotions properly, hence an illusion of certainty in the outcome (the narrator being happy). The narrator, however, values genuine effort over polished words, so the actual outcome (disappointment) contradicts the partner's perceived certainty.

Alternatively, if the partner used AI thinking it would definitely make the narrator happy (pseudocertainty), but the real preference of the narrator was for authenticity regardless of quality, then yes, that fits. The partner overestimated the certainty that a well-written card would lead to a positive response, ignoring the uncertainty about what the narrator truly values. So the effect here would be the partner's belief that using AI ensures a positive outcome, which is a form of pseudocertainty.
</think>

The Pseudocertainty Effect occurs when individuals treat uncertain outcomes as if they are certain due to how choices are framed, often overestimating the likelihood of a positive result because the option appears ""safer"" or more controlled. In this scenario, the partner may have used AI-generated text believing it would *certainly* create a heartfelt, polished message that would please the narrator, assuming that ""better writing"" equates to ""better emotional impact."" This reflects a misjudgment: the partner overvalued the certainty of AI's effectiveness in conveying genuine sentiment, while underestimating the narrator’s preference for authenticity over linguistic perfection. The partner’s choice likely stemmed from a desire to avoid the uncertainty of their own words being perceived as inadequate, opting instead for the illusory certainty of AI’s output. However, the narrator’s disappointment arises precisely because the AI-generated message lacked the personal touch they valued, revealing a mismatch between the partner’s perceived certainty (AI ensures a good outcome) and the reality (authenticity matters more). This aligns with the Pseudocertainty Effect, as the partner acted on an inflated sense of certainty about what would make the narrator happy, neglecting the true uncertainty of the narrator’s preferences.

Pseudocertainty Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

Okay, so I need to figure out if this situation is an example of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Let me start by recalling what that effect is. From what I remember, the Pseudocertainty Effect is a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain when it's actually uncertain, often because they overweigh the probability of a positive outcome when they've passed through a prior risky stage. It's related to the certainty effect in prospect theory, where people prefer sure outcomes over probabilistic ones, even if the expected value is lower. But in pseudocertainty, they might think a two-stage process makes the outcome more certain than it really is.

Looking at the example here: the guy is dropping his secure career and education to pursue singing full-time. He believes that by dedicating more time (quitting his job and school), his music will succeed. His reasoning is that his current lack of success (only 50-100 views) is due to not putting in enough time, so he's certain that full-time effort will lead to success. But in reality, the success is uncertain. He's treating the outcome (success in music) as more certain than it is because he's addressing a prior obstacle (time constraints), which might not be the actual problem. His friends and family's supportive comments (encouraging persistence) might reinforce his belief in a guaranteed outcome if he just works harder, ignoring the actual uncertainty of success in the music industry.

The Pseudocertainty Effect here would be if he's perceiving the success as certain once he removes the time constraint, even though there are other factors (like his singing ability) that make success uncertain. He's focusing on one variable (time invested) as the sole barrier, leading him to a false sense of certainty. His family's support might also contribute to this by not providing honest feedback, reinforcing his belief that success is just a matter of effort, not talent or other factors. So, he's overestimating the certainty of success based on addressing one risk factor (time), ignoring other risks (his skill level, market factors, etc.).
</think>

The scenario described can be analyzed through the lens of the Pseudocertainty Effect, which involves misperceiving an uncertain outcome as certain by overemphasizing controllable factors while neglecting other risks. The individual in question attributes his lack of musical success solely to insufficient time and effort, framing full-time dedication as the definitive solution. By quitting his job and education, he treats the removal of time constraints as a guarantee of future success, ignoring critical uncertainties like his objectively poor singing ability, unoriginal songwriting, and the inherently unpredictable nature of artistic success. 

His reasoning exemplifies pseudocertainty because he conflates addressing one risk factor (time investment) with eliminating all risks, creating an illusion of control over an outcome that remains highly uncertain. External reinforcement from supportive comments (e.g., strangers urging him to ""work harder"") and his family’s unconditional encouragement further amplify this bias, leading him to perceive success as inevitable once he commits fully. However, the reality of his skill level and the competitive music industry introduces significant uncertainty that he fails to acknowledge. Thus, his decision reflects an overestimation of certainty based on partial mitigation of risks, aligning with the Pseudocertainty Effect.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this situation is an example of the Pseudocertainty Effect. First, I need to remember what the Pseudocertainty Effect actually is. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain when in reality it's uncertain, often because they overweigh the probability of a specific event due to the way choices are presented. It's related to decision-making under uncertainty, where people might treat a probable outcome as if it's more certain than it actually is.

The example given here is about the sister-in-law giving DIY gifts that the person doesn't like. They made a comment hoping not to receive more DIY gifts, leading to an argument. The person feels that DIY gifts should only be an addition to a real present and is wondering if they're the asshole.

Wait, how does this relate to Pseudocertainty Effect? Let me think. The Pseudocertainty Effect usually involves situations where people have a false sense of certainty about outcomes. For example, in decision-making scenarios, like choosing between a sure gain and a gamble. If a problem is framed in a way that makes an uncertain outcome seem certain, people might choose differently than if the uncertainty is highlighted.

In the given scenario, the person is certain that the sister-in-law's DIY gifts are not useful or appreciated, and they want her to stop giving them. The sister-in-law's family, however, loves the gifts. The person here might be assuming that the DIY gifts are definitely not good, but the family's reaction shows that there's uncertainty in how the gifts are perceived. But wait, the Pseudocertainty Effect is more about decision-making under risk. The person here is making a judgment about the gifts, perhaps overestimating the certainty that the gifts are bad (since others like them), but I'm not sure if that's exactly the effect.

Alternatively, maybe the person is expecting with certainty that the sister-in-law's future gifts will be DIY (which they don't like), treating it as a certainty when in reality there's a possibility she might give something else. But the person's comment was a hope to avoid more DIY gifts, implying they think it's a sure thing she'll give DIY again. But the sister-in-law's past behavior makes it probable, but not certain. If the person is acting as if it's certain, that might be Pseudocertainty. But I'm not sure if that's the core of the effect here.

Alternatively, maybe the Pseudocertainty Effect isn't the right term here. The effect is more about how people evaluate choices. For example, in a two-stage problem where the first stage has a probable outcome and the second stage is presented as certain, leading people to make different choices. Like, if you have a 50% chance to get to a second stage where you can win $100 for sure, people might treat the second stage as a certainty even though overall it's 50%. But how does that apply here?

Hmm. The person might be certain that the DIY gifts are bad (pseudocertainty) when in reality others like them, so there's uncertainty in the value of the gifts. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the person's expectation that DIY gifts are definitely bad and should not be given, ignoring the uncertainty in others' appreciation. But the effect is more about decision-making under risk, not about social perceptions.

Alternatively, maybe the sister-in-law's family thinks the gifts are good (so there's a positive view) but the person is certain they're bad, perhaps overestimating the certainty of their own judgment. But I'm not sure if that's the Pseudocertainty Effect. Maybe this is more about confirmation bias or a different cognitive bias.

Wait, the Pseudocertainty Effect is when people treat a probable outcome as certain. For example, if you have a 80% chance to win, you might act as if it's 100%. In the scenario, the person is certain that the DIY gifts are bad (maybe based on past experience) and expects them to continue, so they're acting as if it's certain she'll give more DIY gifts. But maybe the sister-in-law could change, but the person is treating it as a certainty. But again, how does this fit the effect?

Alternatively, the person's wife is angry because she's certain that everyone loves the gifts (pseudocertainty) when in reality maybe not everyone does. But the example states that ""apparently everyone in her family loves the gifts"", so maybe the wife is overestimating the family's approval as certain. But the original question is whether the example is an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. The person (the one writing) is the one making the judgment here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the person is using their own certainty about the gifts' lack of value (despite others liking them) as a form of pseudocertainty. But I'm not sure. The key is to determine if the scenario involves someone treating an uncertain outcome as certain when it's not. 

In the example, the person's sister-in-law gives DIY gifts, which they dislike. The person's wife claims that everyone loves them. The person is certain that the gifts are bad (no use, kitschy), but others (the family) see them as thoughtful. So there's a discrepancy in perception. The person is certain that the gifts are bad (pseudocertainty?), but the actual appreciation is uncertain (some like, some don't). But the person is treating their own judgment as certain. However, the Pseudocertainty Effect is more about decision-making under risk where probabilities are misjudged as certain. 

Alternatively, the person might be overconfident in their own assessment (a different bias, like overconfidence), rather than the Pseudocertainty Effect. The effect in question here is about perceived certainty where there is none. 

I'm not sure this scenario fits. The Pseudocertainty Effect is more about how choices are framed leading to a misperception of certainty. For example, if a person chooses a sure option over a probabilistic one because the problem is framed to make the probability seem certain. 

In this case, the conflict is about differing opinions on the value of DIY gifts. The person is certain the gifts are bad, the family thinks they're good. It's a matter of personal preference, not an evaluation of probabilities. Therefore, this might not be an example of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Instead, it's a difference in opinion or perhaps a different bias, like the false consensus effect (assuming others share their views). 

So the answer would be no.
</think>

The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals treat uncertain outcomes as certain, often due to how choices are framed or perceived. In this scenario, the conflict arises from differing opinions about the value of DIY gifts. The person dislikes the gifts, viewing them as useless, while the sister-in-law and her family perceive them as thoughtful. The person’s frustration stems from their certainty that DIY gifts are inherently inadequate, despite others appreciating them. However, this disagreement is rooted in subjective preferences rather than a misjudgment of probabilities or framing of uncertain outcomes as certain. The Pseudocertainty Effect typically involves decision-making under risk, where probabilities are misrepresented (e.g., treating an 80% chance as guaranteed). Here, the issue is a clash of personal tastes, not a cognitive distortion of likelihood or certainty. The person’s stance reflects a strong opinion, not an overestimation of certainty in an uncertain context.

Pseudocertainty Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

Okay, let's try to figure out if this example is an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. Hmm, first I need to remember what the Pseudocertainty Effect actually is. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain when in reality it's uncertain, often because of the way options are presented. It's related to decision-making under risk. People might overestimate the likelihood of a particular outcome because the scenario makes it seem more definite than it is.

In the example given, the woman didn't tell her husband about her ex-boyfriend Dan. The husband then finds out at the party and reacts angrily, leading to a conflict. Now, how does this relate to the Pseudocertainty Effect?

The Pseudocertainty Effect usually involves situations where choices are framed in a way that makes a particular result seem more certain. For example, in some experiments, people might choose a sure gain over a probabilistic one even if the expected value is the same. But here, the situation is about the husband's reaction to not being told about an ex. 

Wait, maybe the husband assumed that since she didn't mention Dan, there must be something to hide. He might have jumped to the conclusion that her omission was a sign of untrustworthiness, treating it as a certainty (she's hiding something) when in reality there's uncertainty (maybe she just didn't think it was important). But does that fit the Pseudocertainty Effect?

Alternatively, the wife might have thought that not mentioning Dan was safe (pseudocertainty that it wouldn't matter) because she considered the past irrelevant. She might have perceived the risk of her husband finding out as low, thus acting as if it was certain that it wouldn't cause an issue. But when the husband did find out, the reality was different. So she underestimated the uncertainty of her husband's reaction.

Alternatively, the husband's reaction could be an overestimation of the certainty of her betrayal. He assumed that not telling him meant she was untrustworthy (a certain negative outcome) when in reality there was uncertainty (maybe she just didn't think it was necessary). So he treated an uncertain situation (her reasons for not telling) as a certain negative outcome (she's hiding something), leading to his angry reaction.

The key here is whether the husband or the wife is exhibiting the Pseudocertainty Effect. The effect is about decision-making under risk where the perception of certainty is inflated. If the husband believed with unwarranted certainty that her omission indicated deceit, then that could be an example. He might have thought, ""She didn't tell me, so she must be lying about other things,"" treating that as a certainty when there's no real evidence. That would fit because he's taking an uncertain situation (her reasons for not mentioning Dan) and treating it as certain (she's untrustworthy), leading to his overreaction.

Alternatively, the wife might have assumed that not mentioning Dan was a safe choice (pseudocertainty that it wouldn't matter), but that's more about overconfidence in her own judgment. But the Pseudocertainty Effect is more about how options are framed leading to a misperception of certainty. In this case, the husband's reaction might stem from perceiving a certain negative outcome (she's untrustworthy) where there's actually uncertainty. So yes, his reaction could be an example of the effect because he's treating her omission as definitive proof of untrustworthiness, a conclusion that's not certain.
</think>

The Pseudocertainty Effect involves perceiving an uncertain outcome as certain due to how a situation is framed, often leading to distorted risk assessments. In this scenario, the husband’s reaction could align with this bias. Upon learning about Dan, he interprets his wife’s omission as definitive evidence of dishonesty or untrustworthiness, treating it as a certainty (e.g., ""She hid this, so she must be hiding more"") rather than acknowledging the ambiguity in her motives (e.g., she may have deemed the information irrelevant). This leap from uncertainty (her reasons for not disclosing) to unwarranted certainty (she is untrustworthy) reflects the Pseudocertainty Effect. His overreaction stems from framing her action as a guaranteed betrayal, ignoring alternative explanations and the lack of evidence for broader deceit. The wife, conversely, may have underestimated the uncertainty of her husband’s reaction, assuming her silence carried no risk—a separate cognitive bias, but not directly the Pseudocertainty Effect. The husband’s behavior better exemplifies the effect due to his treatment of an ambiguous situation as conclusively negative.

Pseudocertainty Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to overestimate the likelihood of certain events or outcomes, especially when they are faced with uncertainty. This can lead to a preference for certainty, even if it is less favorable, over uncertainty, even if it might be more favorable.

In your situation, you are experiencing a significant amount of stress and dissatisfaction in your marriage. You have described a pattern of behavior from your husband that leaves you feeling more like a roommate than a spouse, with a lack of support, intimacy, and financial contribution. Despite these issues, you express fear of the unknown should you decide to leave the marriage.

The fear of the unknown and the preference for the certainty of your current, albeit unhappy, situation over the uncertainty of what might happen if you leave could be an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect. You are aware of the problems in your marriage but are hesitant to take action due to the fear of the uncertainties that come with change.

This bias often leads individuals to believe they can predict or control outcomes more accurately than they actually can.

In the situation you described, it seems that your partner used AI-generated text to create a birthday card for you, possibly in an effort to make it more polished and heartfelt. Your feelings of sadness and a sense of inauthenticity arise from the discrepancy between what you expected (a genuine, heartfelt message from your partner) and what you received (a card that you believe was mostly AI-generated).

This scenario does not directly illustrate the Pseudocertainty Effect. Instead, it seems to be more about the emotional impact of perceived authenticity and effort in personal communication. Your partner may have believed that using AI would make the card more impressive or pleasing to you, but your reaction suggests that the perceived authenticity and personal effort were more important to you than the polished nature of the message.

In summary, this situation is more about the value of authenticity and personal effort in communication rather than an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect.

Pseudocertainty Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"The Pseudocertainty Effect is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the probability of positive outcomes and underestimate the probability of negative outcomes, especially when making decisions under uncertainty. It often involves an overconfidence in one's abilities or the success of a particular choice.

In the scenario described, the individual in question has decided to pursue singing full-time, despite having limited success and feedback suggesting his skills are not yet at a professional level. He attributes his lack of success to not putting in enough time rather than considering his actual talent or the competitive nature of the music industry. This overconfidence in his ability to succeed in a highly competitive field, despite evidence to the contrary, is indicative of the Pseudocertainty Effect.

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)

In the context of your story, the situation described does not directly relate to the Pseudocertainty Effect. The issue at hand revolves around personal preferences, communication, and the perception of thoughtfulness in gift-giving. Your sister-in-law's DIY gifts are based on her personal craftiness and the effort she puts into making them, which is appreciated by some family members. Your wife's reaction to your comment about not wanting more DIY gifts reflects a difference in opinion on what constitutes a thoughtful gift.

This is more about interpersonal dynamics and the subjective nature of gift preferences rather than an instance of the Pseudocertainty Effect.

Pseudocertainty Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

Endowment Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"The concept of the Endowment Effect refers to the tendency for people to overvalue things they own or are associated with, simply because they possess them. This can lead to an irrational attachment or bias towards these things. In the context of relationships, the Endowment Effect can manifest as an overestimation of one's partner's worth or an underestimation of their flaws, due to the emotional investment and attachment one has to the relationship.

In the scenario described, the wife has been in a long-term marriage with her husband, who has a history of speaking to her bluntly and being critical. Despite his harsh words, she has continued to invest emotional labor and effort into the household and their relationship. The wife's self-description as ""a bit of an airhead and ditzy"" and her acknowledgment of making mistakes during the funeral planning suggest that she may be prone to self-doubt and criticism.

However, the husband's repeated labeling of her as ""incompetent"" raises concerns about verbal abuse and gaslighting. The fact that he has a history of speaking to her harshly and that others have noted this behavior as being too harsh suggests that his words may be a form of emotional manipulation rather than constructive criticism.

The wife's difficulty in distinguishing between fair criticism and verbal abuse is understandable, given her emotional investment in the relationship and her desire to maintain a sense of self-worth. The Endowment Effect may be at play here, as she has a strong emotional attachment to her husband and their relationship, which could lead her to downplay or rationalize his hurtful behavior.

The wife's reflection on her own strengths and accomplishments, such as being a good parent and a competent employee, suggests that she is capable of recognizing her own worth and value. However, the husband's repeated criticism and labeling of her as ""incompetent"" may be eroding her self-confidence and making her question her own abilities.

In conclusion, while the Endowment Effect may be influencing the wife's perception of her relationship and her husband's behavior, it is not the primary issue at play. The husband's repeated verbal abuse and criticism are a more significant concern, and the wife's difficulty in distinguishing between fair criticism and verbal abuse is a result of this dynamic.

When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he’s had the pillows and apparently he’s been using them since he was a kid.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

I feel like I can’t even kiss him or anything while we’re sleeping because I don’t want him to get his gross pillowness all over me and my clean pillows. 😂",0,"The concept of the Endowment Effect refers to the tendency for people to overvalue things they own or possess, simply because they own them. This phenomenon was first identified by Richard Thaler in 1980 and has since been extensively studied in the field of behavioral economics. The Endowment Effect suggests that people tend to assign a higher value to an item when they own it, compared to when they do not own it. This can lead to irrational decision-making, as individuals may become overly attached to their possessions and refuse to part with them, even if it would be in their best interest to do so.

In the example provided, the boyfriend's attachment to his old pillows can be seen as an instance of the Endowment Effect. Despite the pillows being old and potentially unhygienic, he refuses to get rid of them because they hold sentimental value. The fact that he has been using them since he was a kid creates an emotional connection, making it difficult for him to part with them. His reluctance to replace the pillows, even when his girlfriend suggests it, illustrates how the Endowment Effect can influence decision-making.

The boyfriend's response to the situation also reveals how the Endowment Effect can lead to a sense of loss aversion. When his girlfriend suggests getting rid of the pillows, he experiences a sense of loss, which outweighs any potential benefits of replacing them. This loss aversion is a key component of the Endowment Effect, as people tend to fear losses more than they value gains.

In contrast, the girlfriend's perspective on the pillows is not influenced by the Endowment Effect, as she does not have an emotional attachment to them. She views the pillows as old and unhygienic, and is willing to take steps to avoid using them. This highlights how the Endowment Effect can create differences in perception and decision-making between individuals, depending on their level of attachment to a particular item.

In conclusion, the boyfriend's refusal to get rid of his old pillows, despite their potential unhygienic nature, is a clear example of the Endowment Effect in action. His emotional attachment to the pillows, combined with his loss aversion, makes it difficult for him to part with them, even when it would be in his best interest to do so.

",0,"The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to overvalue things they own or have a personal connection to, simply because they possess them. This phenomenon was first identified by Richard Thaler in 1980. In the context of gift-giving, the Endowment Effect might manifest as an increased emotional attachment to a gift one has given, due to the thought, effort, and personal significance invested in it.

In the provided example, the individual has put considerable thought and effort into selecting and giving gifts to their family members, such as stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry. These gifts hold sentimental value and represent a tangible expression of their positive regard for the recipients.

When the individual receives gifts in return, such as a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket, they feel undervalued and unappreciated. The perceived lack of effort and thoughtfulness behind these gifts leads to feelings of frustration and disappointment. However, it is essential to consider whether this reaction is an instance of the Endowment Effect.

The Endowment Effect typically involves an overvaluation of one's own possessions or creations due to a sense of ownership or attachment. In this scenario, the individual's negative emotions stem from the perceived disparity between the effort they invested in their gifts and the lack of effort apparent in the gifts they received. While they do express a sense of attachment to the gifts they gave, their primary concern is the feeling of being unappreciated and disrespected by their family members' thoughtless gifts.

The individual's reaction is more closely related to feelings of hurt, disappointment, and possibly even a sense of injustice, rather than an overvaluation of their own gifts due to the Endowment Effect. They are not necessarily placing a higher value on their gifts because they own or gave them, but rather, they are upset because they feel their efforts were not reciprocated with similar thoughtfulness.

Therefore, the individual's emotional response is more likely driven by social and emotional factors, such as the desire for reciprocity, appreciation, and respect, rather than the Endowment Effect.

Endowment Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now.

The teddy bear in question holds significant sentimental value to the writer, having been gifted by a childhood friend and kept for many years. The writer's strong emotional attachment to the teddy bear is evident in their reaction to its disposal, which includes panic, anger, and distress. The fact that the writer went to great lengths to retrieve the teddy bear from the trash and clean it, despite its dirty and stained condition, further illustrates the Endowment Effect.

The writer's behavior can be seen as a manifestation of the Endowment Effect, as they are overvaluing the teddy bear due to their emotional attachment and sense of ownership. The writer's willingness to cause a scene and confront their mother over the disposal of the teddy bear, despite the potential consequences, such as being grounded and having their laptop taken away, also suggests that they are overvaluing the teddy bear.

It is worth noting that the Endowment Effect can lead to irrational decision-making and an overemphasis on the value of possessions. In this case, the writer's reaction to the disposal of the teddy bear may be seen as an overreaction by others, including their family members. However, from the writer's perspective, the teddy bear holds significant emotional value, and its disposal is perceived as a loss of something precious.

In conclusion, the writer's behavior and reaction to the disposal of the teddy bear are consistent with the concept of the Endowment Effect. The strong emotional attachment and sense of ownership that the writer has developed towards the teddy bear have led to an overvaluation of its importance, resulting in a strong reaction to its disposal.

Endowment Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

I just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?",0,"The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to overvalue things they own or possess, simply because they own them. This can apply to physical objects, relationships, or even experiences. In the context of the given scenario, the Endowment Effect might be relevant if Jane's insistence on attending the party and her subsequent behavior could be seen as an overvaluation of her presence in the relationship or her role in the social gathering.

However, the primary issue in this scenario appears to be Jane's discomfort with the idea of her girlfriend spending time without her, and her reaction to being initially excluded from the social event. Jane's behavior, such as getting upset when she's not included, insisting on coming along despite the no-partners rule, and becoming defensive when her girlfriend expresses that her presence ruined the night, suggests a possessiveness or a need for control in the relationship rather than an overvaluation of something she possesses due to ownership.

The Endowment Effect typically involves a misperception of value based on ownership, which is not directly evident in Jane's actions. Her actions seem more related to insecurity, possessiveness, or an inability to respect boundaries within the relationship, rather than an overvaluation of something because she owns or possesses it.

Therefore, while Jane's behavior does indicate some issues related to how she values her presence in social situations involving her girlfriend, it does not clearly demonstrate the Endowment Effect as it is traditionally defined in psychology and economics.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to overvalue things they own or are associated with, simply because they own or are associated with them. This bias can lead individuals to place a higher value on their own possessions, relationships, or even their own children, compared to those of others.

In the given scenario, the narrator's response to his wife's question about why he didn't check on the girl after she fell is a clear illustration of this bias. When his wife points out that if the girl were their own child, they would want someone to warn her about the wet ground, the narrator's response is that since she's not his kid, he doesn't care what happens to her. This reaction demonstrates that he is placing a higher value on his own hypothetical child's well-being than on the well-being of someone else's child, simply because of the association with himself.

This type of thinking is a classic example of the Endowment Effect, where the narrator's ownership or association with something (in this case, his own child) influences his valuation of it. The fact that he is unwilling to show concern for the girl's well-being, despite witnessing her fall and potential injury, suggests that he is overvaluing his own potential child's well-being and undervaluing the well-being of someone else's child.

Furthermore, the narrator's repeated statements of ""not my kid, not my problem"" reinforce this idea, as he is using his association with his own hypothetical child as a justification for his lack of concern for the girl's well-being. This type of thinking is a clear illustration of the Endowment Effect, where the narrator's ownership or association with something is influencing his valuation of it.

This typically results in individuals demanding more compensation to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it in the first place. The focus is on how ownership increases the perceived value of an object, not due to any intrinsic attributes of the object, but rather because it is possessed by the individual.

In the scenario described, the primary issue concerns interpersonal dynamics and communication challenges within a long-term relationship, particularly relating to how the husband treats the wife. This does not appear to involve any aspect of ownership leading to increased perceived value, which is central to the endowment effect. Instead, it is centered on marital issues, respect, and potentially verbal abuse.

Therefore, the scenario does not fit the concept of the endowment effect.

",0,"The Endowment Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This can lead to an emotional attachment to objects and a belief that they are worth more than what others might perceive.

In the situation described, the focus is on the disparity between the effort and meaning put into the gifts given (handmade, thoughtful gifts) versus the perceived lack of effort in the gifts received (generic items like gift cards and a gift basket). The frustration and disappointment arise from the expectation of reciprocity in thoughtfulness and value, rather than from an overvaluation of personally owned items.

The feelings described stem from unmet expectations regarding the reciprocal nature of gift-giving, not from valuing owned items more highly than their market worth due to mere ownership. The dissatisfaction is about perceived imbalance in thoughtfulness and effort, not the increased value attached to owned possessions simply because they are owned.

Therefore, this scenario does not exemplify the Endowment Effect. It instead illustrates sentiments related to expectations and reciprocity in social exchanges.

I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"The Endowment Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. It suggests that ownership creates a strong emotional attachment, leading individuals to perceive their possessions as more valuable than they might actually be to others.

In the scenario described, the individual attributes considerable sentimental value to a teddy bear that was gifted to her in childhood by a friend, marking it as a special and emotionally significant item. Her strong reaction when her mother threw the bear away could be indicative of the Endowment Effect, as her emotional attachment and ownership of the bear seem to have led her to value it more highly than her mother did. The distress caused by the bear's disposal highlights how her personal valuation of the item as an owned possession substantially exceeds the apparent valuation by others (in this case, her mother, who deemed it appropriate to discard the bear).

Therefore, this example can be considered an instance of the Endowment Effect.

In the story provided, the narrator is recounting an incident where they did not help or show concern for a child who fell, on the basis that the child does not belong to them.

I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it.

There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut.

Endowment Effect,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her.

I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago.

",0,"This is not an example of the Endowment Effect. The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on items they own simply because they own them, regardless of their actual market value. For example, someone might be unwilling to sell a coffee mug they own for $5 even though they wouldn't pay more than $3 to buy the same mug.

In this scenario, the person is disappointed by the perceived lack of effort and thoughtfulness in the gifts they received compared to the gifts they gave. This is more about expectations, reciprocity, and feeling undervalued rather than overvaluing something simply because they own it.

The frustration stems from an imbalance in emotional investment and effort in gift-giving, not from an irrational attachment to possessed items, which would be characteristic of the Endowment Effect.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Endowment Effect. The Endowment Effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals place a higher value on objects they own, compared to identical objects they do not own. In this case, your boyfriend seems to be demonstrating the endowment effect by valuing his old, sentimental pillows more than the clean pillows you prefer, even though they are functionally identical.

By asking him to get rid of his pillows, you were essentially asking him to give up something he values, which he was unwilling to do. This resistance to parting with the pillows, despite their perceived 'grossness' or lack of cleanliness, is a clear indication of the endowment effect.

Furthermore, the fact that he was willing to let you bring your own pillows, but not give up his, shows that he places a higher value on his own pillows due to their sentimental value, even though they may not be as comfortable or clean for you.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Endowment Effect. This psychological phenomenon suggests that people tend to overvalue items they own, relative to their willingness to pay for the same items when they do not own them.

As a result, you've developed an emotional attachment to these gifts, and you perceive them as having a higher value than the Starbucks gift card and hot chocolate basket your family members gave you.

This emotional attachment to the gifts you gave causes you to feel undervalued and frustrated when you receive what you perceive as less thoughtful and less valuable gifts in return.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now.

The example provided above is an instance of the Endowment Effect, a behavioral economics phenomenon where individuals place a higher value on an item they own compared to an identical item they do not own. In this case, the individual (19f) places a high sentimental value on her teddy bear, which she has owned for a significant period of time. When her mother, who does not share the same sentimental attachment, throws away the teddy bear, the individual perceives it as a loss and overreacts, demonstrating the endowment effect. She values the teddy bear more than her family values her peace and the cleanliness of their home, leading to the scene and the subsequent conflict.",,yes,

Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Endowment Effect, a behavioral economics concept. In this case, your girlfriend (Jane) seems to be exhibiting the endowment effect by valuing her presence at your social gatherings more than you value her absence. She feels entitled to be included, even when it's clear that her presence is causing discomfort and negatively impacting the social dynamics.

The endowment effect occurs when individuals overvalue things merely because they possess them. In this context, Jane is not just valuing her relationship with you, but also the social events that you both attend. She seems to believe that she has a right to be present at these events, regardless of how they affect the dynamics or the enjoyment of others.

Your girlfriend's reaction to being excluded from the social event and her subsequent insistence on attending, despite the negative impact on the group, is a manifestation of the endowment effect. She feels that her presence is a given, and when that expectation is not met, she feels hurt and upset.",,no,

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0," ANSWER: No

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of the **Endowment Effect**, let's first define the concept. The **Endowment Effect** is a cognitive bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them, or are emotionally attached to them, compared to things they do not own or are less attached to. It often manifests in situations where individuals overvalue their possessions, relationships, or even their own behaviors, simply because they are ""theirs.""

In the given example, the focus is on the husband's harsh criticism of the wife's perceived incompetence, the wife's self-doubt, and the dynamics of their relationship. There is no indication that either party is overvaluing something they own or are emotionally attached to simply because it is ""theirs."" Instead, the situation revolves around interpersonal conflict, verbal abuse, and self-esteem issues, not the misvaluation of possessions or relationships due to ownership or attachment.

The wife questions whether her husband's criticism is fair or abusive, but this does not involve the Endowment Effect. The husband's behavior seems more related to patterns of control, disrespect, or possibly emotional abuse, rather than a cognitive bias toward overvaluing something because it is his. Similarly, the wife's self-reflection does not suggest she is overvaluing her relationship due to ownership or attachment—she is questioning its health and her own worth within it.

Thus, this scenario does not align with the definition or typical manifestations of the Endowment Effect.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

The Endowment Effect refers to the tendency for people to value an object more highly simply because they own it, often leading them to demand a higher price to sell it than they would be willing to pay to acquire it. In this case, the boyfriend's attachment to his pillows is framed as **sentimental value** rather than an inflated valuation due to ownership. His refusal to part with the pillows stems from emotional attachment (e.g., childhood memories) rather than an irrational overvaluation of their objective worth. 

The Endowment Effect typically involves a disconnect between willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept prices in economic terms, which isn't evident here. Instead, this is more about personal attachment or nostalgia. That said, one could argue there's a *hint* of the Endowment Effect if his sentimental attachment leads him to overvalue the pillows relative to their actual utility or hygiene, but the primary driver seems to be emotional history, not ownership per se.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

",0,"The scenario you described does **not** appear to be an instance of the **Endowment Effect**. Here’s why:

The **Endowment Effect** refers to the tendency for people to value an item more highly simply because they own it or have a sense of possession over it. It often manifests as an irrational preference for retaining something one already has over acquiring something of equal or greater value. For example, someone might refuse to sell a mug they own for $10 but also refuse to buy the same mug for $5 if they didn’t already own it.

In your case, the emotional reaction stems from:
1. **Disappointment in perceived effort mismatch**: You put significant thought and effort into your gifts, while feeling the gifts you received were low-effort and impersonal.
2. **Violation of reciprocity norms**: Even though you claim it’s not ""quid pro quo,"" there’s an implicit expectation of some level of mutual consideration, which was unmet.
3. **Feeling undervalued or mocked**: The reaction is tied to social dynamics and self-worth, not an overvaluation of your own gifts due to ownership.

Your frustration is more about **social exchange theory** (expectations of reciprocity) or **gift-giving norms** than the Endowment Effect. The Endowment Effect would apply if, say, you valued the gifts you gave *more* simply because you chose them, while others might not see them as special. But your distress is rooted in the *comparative effort*, not an irrational overvaluation of your own possessions.

Thus, this is not an example of the Endowment Effect.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example provided is an instance of the Endowment Effect. First, I need to recall what the Endowment Effect is. From what I remember, the Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. For example, someone might value a mug they own more than an identical mug they don't own, simply because it's theirs. It's about ownership leading to higher valuation.

Now, looking at the example given. The situation described involves a husband frequently criticizing his wife, calling her incompetent, especially referencing mistakes she made during a stressful time like funeral planning. The wife is questioning if she's being fairly criticized or abused, and mentions past instances where others noted the husband's harshness. She also tried to leave before but was convinced to stay. 

Wait, but how does this relate to the Endowment Effect? The Endowment Effect is about valuing owned items more. The husband's behavior here seems more about verbal abuse or harsh criticism rather than ownership or valuation of possessions. The wife is feeling undervalued, but that's not exactly the same as the Endowment Effect. 

Alternatively, maybe the husband is overvaluing his own contributions or his own way of doing things, thus devaluing his wife's efforts because he's used to his ownership of certain roles? But that's a stretch. The Endowment Effect typically involves tangible items or maybe even ideas one feels ownership over. The husband's criticism seems more about perceived incompetence rather than overvaluing something he owns. 

Another angle: does the husband value his own opinions or his way of handling things more because they're his (endowment), leading him to dismiss his wife's methods? Possibly, but the examples given are more about him being critical and demeaning. The core of the Endowment Effect is ownership leading to higher valuation, not necessarily criticism. 

So, in this case, the main issue is the husband's harsh treatment and possible verbal abuse. The wife's questioning if she deserves being called incompetent. There's no direct link to ownership leading to higher valuation here. The Endowment Effect doesn't seem to apply. The situation is more about interpersonal conflict and abusive behavior rather than cognitive bias related to ownership.
</think>

The Endowment Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals ascribe greater value to items or outcomes simply because they own them or are associated with them. This bias typically manifests in scenarios involving ownership, possession, or attachment to objects, ideas, or roles, leading people to overvalue what they ""have"" compared to alternatives they do not. 

In the example provided, the husband’s behavior centers on harsh criticism, demeaning language, and patterns of verbal abuse directed at his wife, particularly during stressful situations like funeral planning or technical difficulties. The wife questions whether his critiques are fair or abusive, but this dynamic does not align with the Endowment Effect. The husband’s actions reflect interpersonal conflict, possible emotional abuse, and frustration, not an overvaluation of his own possessions, roles, or decisions due to ownership. 

The Endowment Effect might apply if, for instance, the husband irrationally valued his own contributions (e.g., his approach to household responsibilities) over his wife’s due to a sense of ownership over those roles. However, the described behavior focuses on disparagement rather than an inflated sense of value tied to ownership. The wife’s self-doubt and the husband’s aggression stem from relational dynamics and stress, not a cognitive bias rooted in ownership-driven valuation.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

Thoughts? I feel like I can’t even kiss him or anything while we’re sleeping because I don’t want him to get his gross pillowness all over me and my clean pillows. 😂",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of the endowment effect. Hmm. The endowment effect is when people value something more just because they own it. So, the owner places a higher value on an object than someone who doesn't own it.

In the example, the boyfriend has these old pillows he's had since he was a kid. He's attached to them and doesn't want to get rid of them, even though the girlfriend finds them gross. He calls them 'sentimental', which suggests he has an emotional attachment. The girlfriend wants to bring her own pillows, which he's okay with, but he refuses to discard his own. 

Wait, the endowment effect isn't just about sentimental value. It's about ownership increasing the perceived value. If he values the pillows more because they're his, even if others don't see their worth, that's the endowment effect. The sentimental part might be part of it, but the key is that he's unwilling to part with them because they're his. 

Alternatively, if the pillows have sentimental value beyond mere ownership, like memories from childhood, maybe that's different. But the endowment effect can still apply here. The fact that he owns them and thus values them more than others do, even if there's sentiment, fits. Because even if there's sentimental reasons, the effect can coexist. The main point is ownership leading to higher valuation. 

So, the boyfriend's refusal to get rid of his pillows despite the girlfriend's concerns and his willingness to let her bring her own suggests he overvalues his own pillows because they're his. So yes, this is an example of the endowment effect.
</think>

The endowment effect occurs when individuals ascribe higher value to items they own simply because of their ownership, often leading them to demand more to part with an object than others would pay to acquire it. In this scenario, the boyfriend’s attachment to his old, sentimental pillows aligns with this concept. Despite the girlfriend’s discomfort with the pillows’ condition, he refuses to discard them, emphasizing their sentimental value. His reluctance to part with the pillows—even when presented with a practical alternative (her bringing her own)—suggests that ownership and personal history have inflated his perceived value of the pillows beyond their objective utility or hygiene. While sentimental attachment can exist independently, the endowment effect often intertwines with such emotional ties, as ownership itself becomes a key factor in valuation. The boyfriend’s prioritization of retaining his pillows over accommodating his partner’s preference (without opposing her solution) highlights how ownership influences his valuation.

Endowment Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of the Endowment Effect. Hmm. First, I need to recall what the Endowment Effect actually is. From what I remember, the Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. So, someone might value an item they own more than the same item if they didn't own it. Like, if you have a coffee mug, you might demand more money to sell it than you'd be willing to pay to buy one.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person here loves giving thoughtful gifts and puts a lot of effort into them. They gave handmade items like stained glass, porcelain bowls, and silver jewelry. But they received generic gifts like a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate basket. They felt unappreciated and like a fool, thinking the gifts they got were low effort. The emotional reaction is feeling hurt and frustrated.

Wait, the Endowment Effect is about valuing your own possessions more. But here, the person is upset about the gifts they received, not about something they owned and overvalued. The gifts they gave were theirs (since they gave them), but their reaction is about the gifts they received. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Endowment Effect applies when they value the gifts they gave more than others would. But the Endowment Effect is about ownership increasing value. So, perhaps when they created or selected the gifts, they overvalue those gifts compared to how others value them. But the problem here is the reciprocal gifts they received. The person feels their effort wasn't matched. 

Wait, the key point of the Endowment Effect is ownership leading to higher valuation. The example's main issue is the disparity in perceived effort between the gifts given and received. The person's negative feelings stem from feeling that others didn't put in the same effort. But how does that tie into the Endowment Effect? Maybe if the person overvalued the gifts they gave (because they put effort into them) and expected others to value them similarly, leading to disappointment when others didn't. But that might be more about effort and expectations rather than ownership. 

Alternatively, the Endowment Effect might come into play if the person values the gifts they gave more highly because they own them (or created them), but the problem here is the gifts received. The person is not claiming that the gifts they gave are more valuable than they are, but that the gifts they received were low effort. So maybe this isn't about the Endowment Effect. Instead, it's more about reciprocity expectations or effort comparison. The Endowment Effect is about ownership increasing perceived value, not about the effort in gift-giving. 

Another angle: maybe the person values their own time and effort (the endowment here being their own labor) in creating the gifts, leading them to overvalue those gifts. But the effect is about the items themselves. Alternatively, if the person felt that their handmade items were more valuable than the recipients treated them, but the recipients' low-effort gifts don't directly relate to the Endowment Effect. 

I think the key here is that the Endowment Effect involves valuing something more because you own it. The scenario here is more about the giver feeling unappreciated because the recipients didn't match their effort. The giver's own gifts are thoughtful and handmade (so they might value them highly due to their effort), but the issue is the reciprocal gifts. The Endowment Effect doesn't directly explain the feeling of being underappreciated. Instead, this might relate to something like the thought-effort disparity or expectation of reciprocity. 

Therefore, this example doesn't seem to be an instance of the Endowment Effect. The person isn't overvaluing something they own; they're upset about the lack of effort in the gifts they received. The Endowment Effect is about ownership affecting valuation, not about the effort in gift exchange.
</think>

The example provided does not align with the **Endowment Effect**. The Endowment Effect refers to the tendency for individuals to assign higher value to items they own simply because they own them, often demanding more to part with a possession than they would pay to acquire it. In this scenario, the emotional distress stems from a perceived mismatch in effort and thoughtfulness between the gifts given and those received. The individual values the time and care they invested in selecting or creating handmade gifts, but their frustration arises from feeling unappreciated due to receiving generic, low-effort gifts in return. 

The core issue here relates more to **expectations of reciprocity** or **effort comparison** rather than ownership-driven valuation. The Endowment Effect typically involves overvaluing one's own possessions (e.g., refusing to sell a mug for $10 while being unwilling to buy the same mug for $5). In this case, the negative emotions are tied to social dynamics and unmet expectations of mutual effort, not to an inflated valuation of the gifts the individual themselves owns.

Endowment Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the Endowment Effect. First, I need to remember what the Endowment Effect is. From what I recall, the Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. So, someone would value an item they own more than the same item if they didn't own it. For example, if you have a coffee mug you really like, you might value it higher than someone else would, just because it's yours.

In the scenario described, the person has a teddy bear that was given to them by a childhood friend. They've kept it for a long time and consider it a sentimental item. The mom threw it away, leading to a big emotional reaction. The person is upset because the teddy bear has a lot of sentimental value to them. Now, does this align with the Endowment Effect?

The Endowment Effect is about ownership increasing perceived value. Here, the ownership is clear—the teddy belongs to the person. But the key here is the sentimental attachment. The person values the teddy not just because they own it, but because of the memories and emotional significance attached to it. The Endowment Effect typically refers to valuing something more because you own it, not necessarily because of sentimental reasons. However, the two can overlap. If the person values the teddy more than others would (like the mom thinking it's just an old toy), that might be the Endowment Effect in action. The mom doesn't see the value, but the owner does, perhaps because of ownership leading to higher valuation beyond objective factors.

Another angle: the Endowment Effect is often demonstrated in scenarios where people are unwilling to part with an item unless paid more than its market value. In this case, the person wasn't willing to part with the teddy at all, even when the mom tried to discard it. The emotional reaction suggests a higher personal valuation, which could be due to the Endowment Effect. But maybe the primary driver here is emotional attachment rather than ownership per se. However, ownership is a part of that attachment. The person feels a sense of ownership which contributes to the higher valuation. 

Wait, but the Endowment Effect is more about the ownership itself leading to higher value, not the sentimental reasons. For example, in experiments, people given a mug demand more to sell it than others are willing to pay, even if there's no sentimental value. So if the person here values the teddy because of the memories, maybe that's a different concept, like sentimental value. But the line might be blurry. The Endowment Effect could still apply here because the individual's ownership leads them to value it more than others do, regardless of the reason. The fact that they own it and have it in their possession might amplify their attachment, even if the main reason is sentimental. 

So in conclusion, this situation does involve the Endowment Effect because the person values the teddy bear more than others (the mother) do, primarily because they own it and have a personal attachment. The mother doesn't share the same valuation, leading to the conflict. Even though there's a strong sentimental component, the Endowment Effect could still be at play here as ownership enhances the perceived value beyond what others see.
</think>

The example provided does align with the concept of the **Endowment Effect**, though the connection involves some nuance. The Endowment Effect describes the tendency for individuals to value items they own more highly than identical items they do not own, often due to psychological ownership and attachment. In this scenario, the teddy bear holds significant sentimental value for the individual because of its association with childhood memories and a lost friendship. While the primary driver of the attachment appears emotional, the Endowment Effect still applies because the individual's ownership of the teddy bear amplifies its perceived value beyond its objective worth. 

The mother, lacking the same emotional and psychological connection to the teddy bear, views it as replaceable or disposable—a perspective starkly different from the owner's. This disparity in valuation is characteristic of the Endowment Effect: the owner (the daughter) assigns greater value to the item due to her ownership and personal history with it, while others (the mother) do not share this heightened valuation. The daughter's intense reaction—retrieving the bear from the trash, emotional distress, and conflict with her family—underscores how ownership and attachment inflate the item's importance to her, even if the item itself has no inherent market value. Thus, while sentimental attachment plays a role, the Endowment Effect explains the divergence in perceived value between the owner and non-owner.

Endowment Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

I just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the endowment effect. Hmm. So the endowment effect is when people value something more highly simply because they own it. Like, if you have a mug and someone offers to buy it, you might ask for more money than you'd be willing to pay to buy the same mug.

In this scenario, the girlfriend (Jane) is insisting on coming to the parties even though she doesn't get along with the friends. The parties are supposed to be no-partners allowed. The user ended up bringing her, and it ruined the night. Then Jane was gloating about having fun, but the user felt the opposite. The user told her she ruined the night.

Wait, how does this relate to the endowment effect? The endowment effect is about ownership increasing valuation. Maybe if Jane feels that because she's the girlfriend, she has a right to be there (ownership of the relationship or the event), so she values her presence more than others do. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is experiencing loss aversion, not wanting to lose time with friends because Jane is there. But that's not exactly the endowment effect.

Alternatively, maybe Jane overvalues her own participation in the events because she's part of the relationship (ownership), so she's attached to the idea that she should be included. But the endowment effect typically refers to items you own, not social situations. Wait, but maybe in a broader sense, if Jane considers her role as a partner as something she 'owns', leading her to overvalue her right to be at the events. Like, she feels entitled because she's in the relationship, thus valuing her attendance more than others do. That could be a stretch. Alternatively, the user might be experiencing the endowment effect by valuing their own time with friends more once they have it, but the conflict is about Jane wanting to be included.

Hmm. The key here is whether Jane's insistence on coming is because she overvalues her own presence due to ownership (like, she's part of the relationship, so she feels she owns the right to attend). Or maybe the user is valuing their own plans more once they have them (but the user is the one who wants to go without her). 

Alternatively, maybe Jane is exhibiting the endowment effect by valuing her own role in the user's life so much that she can't accept not being part of the event. But I'm not sure. The endowment effect is more about ownership leading to higher valuation. If Jane feels that because she's the girlfriend, she 'owns' the right to be at the events, then she might overvalue her presence there. But I'm not certain. Another angle: the user might have planned the night with friends (ownership of the plan) and thus values it more, but that's not the main conflict here. The main conflict is Jane wanting to come even when she's not invited and causing issues. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's friends have the endowment effect regarding their own events. But the question is about the example given, which centers around Jane's behavior. 

I'm leaning towards no, because the endowment effect typically involves ownership of an object or a specific item leading to higher valuation, not social situations or relationship dynamics. Jane's behavior seems more about possessiveness, insecurity, or fear of missing out rather than the endowment effect. The endowment effect would be if, say, the user didn't want to give up their spot at the party because they already had it, but that's not the case here. Jane's insistence on coming might be more about control or attachment, not ownership leading to higher valuation. So perhaps this isn't an example of the endowment effect.
</think>

The scenario described does not clearly exemplify the **endowment effect**, which refers to the tendency for people to assign greater value to items or opportunities simply because they own or possess them. The endowment effect typically manifests in situations where ownership (e.g., of a physical object, a ticket to an event, or a specific role) leads individuals to overvalue what they have compared to equivalent alternatives they do not own. 

In this case, Jane’s insistence on attending the partner-free gatherings stems from relational dynamics, such as insecurity, possessiveness, or a desire for inclusion, rather than an overvaluation of something she already owns. The conflict arises from her belief that her role as a partner entitles her to participate in events explicitly designated for friends only, even when her presence creates tension. However, this entitlement is more closely tied to interpersonal expectations or attachment issues than to the psychological ownership central to the endowment effect. The user, meanwhile, values their pre-existing plans with friends, but this preference reflects a desire for autonomy or boundary-setting rather than an ownership-driven overvaluation. 

The endowment effect would apply if, for example, Jane or the user irrationally valued an object (e.g., a party invitation) more highly because they possessed it, but the described situation focuses on social friction and relationship boundaries. Jane’s behavior aligns more with jealousy or control, while the user’s frustration relates to disrupted social dynamics. Neither party’s actions hinge on the cognitive bias of overvaluing owned items or opportunities.

Endowment Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA for not asking if someone was okay?
Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example provided is an instance of the Endowment Effect. Hmm. First, I need to recall what the Endowment Effect actually is. From what I remember, the Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Like, if someone owns an item, they value it more than someone who doesn't own it. For example, in experiments, people might demand a higher price to sell a coffee mug they own than they would be willing to pay to buy the same mug.

Now, looking at the example here. The scenario is about a man who didn't help a girl who fell, and his wife is upset because he didn't check on the girl. His reasoning is ""not my kid, not my problem."" The wife argues that if it were their kid, they'd want someone to help. 

Wait, how does this relate to the Endowment Effect? The Endowment Effect is about ownership increasing valuation. The man here is showing a lack of concern for a child that isn't his. The wife is pointing out that he would care more if the child were his own. So, the idea here might be that people value their own possessions (or in this case, their own children) more than others'. The man doesn't value the girl's well-being because she's not his, implying that if she were his, he would value her more. That does seem similar to the Endowment Effect, where ownership (in this case, parental ownership) leads to higher valuation. 

But wait, the Endowment Effect is typically about goods or possessions. Here, it's about a person, a child. Does the effect apply to people as well? I'm not sure. Maybe the concept can be extended, but perhaps there's a different term for this kind of in-group bias or favoritism towards one's own family. Alternatively, the Endowment Effect might still apply if the man's lack of action is because he doesn't ""own"" the child, so he doesn't value her well-being as much as he would his own. 

Alternatively, maybe the wife is appealing to the Golden Rule (treat others as you would want to be treated), which is a different concept. The man's indifference could be due to a lack of empathy unless it directly affects him. But the Endowment Effect is more about the ownership leading to higher valuation, not necessarily empathy. 

So, in this case, the man's valuation of the child's safety is lower because she's not his. If she were his, he would value her safety more. This aligns with the Endowment Effect's premise where ownership (being the parent) increases the value placed on the child's well-being. Therefore, this situation could be an example of the Endowment Effect. But I need to be careful. The Endowment Effect is usually about goods, but maybe it's applicable here metaphorically. Alternatively, maybe this is more about in-group bias or kinship altruism. However, the key element here is the difference in valuation based on ownership (or possession), which is the crux of the Endowment Effect. 

Therefore, I think the answer would be yes, this is an instance of the Endowment Effect. The man doesn't value the girl's well-being because she's not his, whereas if she were his child (his 'endowment'), he would care more. The wife's argument highlights that discrepancy in valuation based on ownership.
</think>

The Endowment Effect refers to the tendency of individuals to value an item or entity more highly simply because they own it or feel a sense of possession over it. In the provided scenario, the man’s indifference to the injured girl’s well-being—exemplified by his statement, “not my kid, not my problem”—contrasts sharply with the concern he would likely feel if the child were his own. This disparity in valuation aligns with the core idea of the Endowment Effect: ownership (or perceived ownership, such as parental responsibility) increases the subjective value placed on the entity in question. 

The man’s lack of action stems from the absence of a personal connection or “ownership” over the child, leading him to undervalue her safety compared to how he would value his own child’s. His wife’s criticism underscores this discrepancy, pointing out that he would expect others to care if the roles were reversed. While the Endowment Effect is often discussed in the context of physical goods, the psychological mechanism—valuing something more due to a sense of possession or association—applies here metaphorically. The man’s reduced concern for a child he does not “own” reflects the same cognitive bias, albeit extended to human relationships rather than material objects.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

In the scenario you've described, your boyfriend's attachment to his pillows, despite their age and possibly unhygienic condition, could be seen as an instance of the endowment effect. He values the pillows more than you do, likely due to sentimental reasons, which is a common manifestation of the endowment effect. His reluctance to part with them, even though you've offered a practical alternative (bringing your own pillows), further suggests that the emotional attachment he has to the pillows is driving his decision.

Endowment Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.
",0,"The Endowment Effect is a concept in behavioral economics that describes the phenomenon where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This effect is often observed when people are reluctant to part with an item they own, even if it is objectively less valuable than a similar item they do not own.

In the scenario you've described, it does not directly illustrate the Endowment Effect. Instead, it seems to reflect a situation where you feel undervalued or unappreciated because the gifts you received were not commensurate with the effort and thought you put into the gifts you gave. This feeling of being undervalued or unappreciated is more aligned with social expectations and reciprocity norms rather than the Endowment Effect.

The Endowment Effect would be more applicable if you were describing a situation where you valued a gift you received more highly simply because it was yours, even if it was objectively less valuable than a similar gift you did not own.

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"The Endowment Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This often leads to people valuing their own possessions more highly than similar items owned by others, and it can result in a reluctance to part with these possessions even when offered fair market value or more.

In the scenario described, the individual expresses a strong emotional attachment to a teddy bear that was a gift from a childhood friend. This attachment is not merely sentimental but also tied to the bear's history and the memories associated with it. The individual's reaction to the bear being thrown away by their mother is intense and emotional, reflecting the bear's personal significance.

The Endowment Effect is evident here because the individual places a high value on the teddy bear not just because of its material worth, but because of the emotional and personal value it holds. This value is not easily quantifiable and is likely much higher for the individual than it would be for someone else who does not share the same history or emotional connection with the bear.

The individual's reaction to the bear being thrown away can be seen as an overreaction from the perspective of someone who does not understand the emotional attachment, but it is a natural response from someone experiencing the Endowment Effect. The bear's sentimental value to the individual far outweighs its objective value, leading to a strong emotional response when it is discarded.

Therefore, the scenario is an instance of the Endowment Effect.

Endowment Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

The Endowment Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. In this situation, the issue revolves around the dynamics of a social event and personal relationships, specifically the tension between wanting to spend time with friends without a partner and the partner's desire to be included in all social activities.

The Endowment Effect would be more relevant if, for example, Jane placed a higher value on certain possessions (like gifts or shared items) simply because they belonged to her, and this valuation affected her behavior or decisions. However, the described situation is more about social boundaries, personal space, and the expectations within a relationship rather than the valuation of possessions.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her.

Naive Cynicism,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The concept of Naive Cynicism refers to the tendency to attribute ulterior motives to others, often in a way that is overly simplistic or cynical. In this context, the boyfriend's behavior can be seen as an example of Naive Cynicism. He is attributing Rachel Zegler's comments and behavior to her being ""full of herself,"" ""too smug,"" and ""thinks she's smart,"" rather than considering the possibility that she is simply expressing her genuine opinions and feelings.

Moreover, his reaction to Rachel Zegler's comment about Snow White being scary is disproportionate and reveals a deeper issue. He is not just disagreeing with her opinion, but is instead taking it as a personal attack on a ""sacred"" classic. This overreaction suggests that he is not just criticizing her opinion, but is also trying to police her behavior and speech.

The boyfriend's comment about feminism being ""cute and likable"" for dudes is also telling. He is implying that women should present themselves in a way that is palatable to men, rather than being authentic and expressive. This attitude is a classic example of patriarchal nonsense, where women are expected to conform to societal norms and expectations in order to avoid being seen as ""annoying"" or ""unlikable.""

The fact that he tells the girlfriend that she doesn't actually like Rachel Zegler, but is only defending her because she is a feminist, is also a form of Naive Cynicism. He is attributing the girlfriend's opinions and feelings to a simplistic motive (i.e., that she is only defending Rachel Zegler because of her feminist ideology), rather than considering the possibility that she has her own thoughts and feelings about the matter.

Overall, the boyfriend's behavior in this scenario is a textbook example of Naive Cynicism, as he is attributing ulterior motives to Rachel Zegler and the girlfriend, and is trying to police their behavior and speech in order to maintain his own comfort and sense of control.

In the context of the provided example, the girlfriend (28f) is concerned about her boyfriend's (25m) old pillows and doesn't want to sleep on them due to hygiene concerns. Her boyfriend responds by expressing sadness that something as ""small"" as pillows might come between them spending the night together, but ultimately understands her decision to go home.

The girlfriend's interpretation of her boyfriend's response and behavior can be seen as an instance of Naive Cynicism. She seems to be attributing her boyfriend's attachment to his old pillows to a lack of concern for her feelings or hygiene, rather than considering the sentimental value he has assigned to them. Her comment about not wanting to kiss him or get close to him due to his ""gross pillowness"" suggests that she is assuming he is being intentionally careless or insensitive to her concerns.

However, her boyfriend's response and behavior do not necessarily support this interpretation. He acknowledges her concerns, offers a reasonable explanation for keeping the pillows (sentimental value), and is willing to accommodate her by allowing her to bring her own pillows. This suggests that he is not being malicious or selfish, but rather has a genuine emotional attachment to the pillows.

Furthermore, the girlfriend's expectation that her boyfriend should simply get rid of his old pillows because they are ""gross"" to her can be seen as an oversimplification of the situation. She is not considering the potential emotional significance of the pillows to her boyfriend, and instead is assuming that he should prioritize her preferences over his own sentimental attachments.

In conclusion, the girlfriend's thoughts and feelings about the situation can be seen as an instance of Naive Cynicism, as she is attributing overly simplistic or selfish motivations to her boyfriend's behavior. However, it is also possible to interpret the situation as a genuine difference in values or priorities, rather than a reflection of her boyfriend's character or intentions.

In the provided example, the individual exhibits several characteristics that are consistent with Naive Cynicism. They claim to have received information from ""voices in my head"" that has allowed them to ""connect all the dots"" and uncover a supposed conspiracy involving undercover agents working for secret organizations. This suggests a lack of critical thinking and a reliance on unverifiable sources of information.

The individual also demonstrates a tendency to jump to conclusions, assuming that others are watching them and gathering intelligence without providing any concrete evidence to support these claims. They believe that hidden cameras are monitoring their every move and that undercover agents are following them, despite a lack of tangible proof.

Furthermore, the individual's reasoning is circular and self-reinforcing. They claim that their voices have told them about the conspiracy, and that the fact that others are supposedly trying to extract information from them confirms the existence of the conspiracy. This creates a closed system of thinking where the individual is resistant to alternative explanations or contradictory evidence.

The individual's beliefs about aliens walking among us disguised as normal people and their possession of secret information about the location of aliens also suggest a paranoid and delusional mindset. The fact that they were removed from a group chat after accusing others of being undercover agents is taken as confirmation of their suspicions, rather than considering the possibility that they may have been removed due to their own behavior or accusations.

Overall, the example provided exhibits many characteristics of Naive Cynicism, including a lack of critical thinking, a tendency to jump to conclusions, and a failure to consider alternative explanations. The individual's reliance on unverifiable sources of information and their circular reasoning also contribute to this assessment.

Naive Cynicism,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"The concept of Naive Cynicism refers to the tendency to assume that others are motivated by selfish or manipulative intentions, even when their actions can be explained by more benign or innocent reasons. In the context of the provided example, the wife's behavior can be seen as an instance of Naive Cynicism.

However, when the situation becomes more complicated, and the husband is unable to complete the task as quickly as expected, the wife becomes upset and accusatory. She assumes that the husband is being lazy or unwilling to help her, rather than considering the legitimate constraints of his work schedule and the limitations of the tire repair service.

The wife's reaction is characterized by a lack of empathy and understanding, as well as a tendency to jump to negative conclusions about the husband's motivations. She sends angry texts, refuses to listen to his explanations, and makes dramatic statements about how he has ""ruined everything."" This behavior suggests that she is interpreting the husband's actions through a cynical lens, assuming that he is acting out of selfish or uncooperative intentions, rather than considering the possibility that he is simply trying to balance his work responsibilities with her request for help.

Furthermore, the wife's behavior is not justified by the husband's actions, which seem reasonable and accommodating given the circumstances. The husband is willing to help his wife, but he also has legitimate constraints and priorities, such as his work schedule and the need to communicate with his wife about the situation. The wife's failure to consider these factors and her tendency to assume the worst about her husband's motivations are characteristic of Naive Cynicism.

In the context of the provided example, the speaker's girlfriend exhibits behaviors that could be perceived as secretive or evasive, such as being private on social media, driving conversations towards the speaker's interests, and being possessive about her phone.

The speaker's interpretation of these behaviors is that they are ""sus"" (suspicious) and that the girlfriend's secrecy is causing them mental distress. They are wondering if the girlfriend truly likes them and are concerned that they might not be good enough for her. This line of thinking suggests that the speaker is making assumptions about the girlfriend's intentions and motivations based on limited information.

However, it's essential to consider alternative explanations for the girlfriend's behavior. For instance, her secrecy and possessiveness about her phone could be due to personal boundaries, past experiences, or simply a preference for privacy. The fact that she is open with her best friend Marie suggests that she is capable of forming close relationships, but perhaps she is more guarded around others, including the speaker.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol.

I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

AITA?",0,"The concept of Naive Cynicism refers to the tendency to assume that others are acting in bad faith or with ulterior motives, often due to a lack of understanding or empathy. In this scenario, the teacher initially assumed that the student was either trying to get out of class or exaggerating his symptoms, rather than taking his complaint of a migraine at face value. This assumption led the teacher to downplay the student's condition and not take immediate action to address his needs.

The teacher's reasoning was based on a cynical view of the student's motivations, rather than considering the possibility that the student was genuinely unwell. This lack of empathy and understanding led to a delay in providing the student with the care he needed, which ultimately resulted in him fainting in class.

The teacher's actions were not necessarily malicious, but rather a result of their own biases and assumptions. The fact that the teacher is now questioning their actions and considering the possibility that they were wrong suggests that they are beginning to recognize the flaws in their initial reasoning.

In this case, the teacher's initial response to the student's complaint can be seen as an instance of Naive Cynicism, as they assumed the worst about the student's motivations without considering alternative explanations. The teacher's subsequent reflection on their actions and consideration of alternative perspectives suggests that they are capable of growth and self-awareness.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"The concept of Naive Cynicism refers to the tendency to attribute negative intentions or motivations to others, often based on incomplete or inaccurate information. In the context of the given example, the girlfriend's behavior and expectations can be seen as an instance of Naive Cynicism.

The girlfriend woke up quiet and didn't respond to her boyfriend's attempts to talk to her. Instead of communicating her needs or her condition (low blood sugar), she expected her boyfriend to somehow intuitively know that she needed help with making food. When he didn't meet her expectations, she became upset and accused him of being inconsiderate.

This reaction suggests that the girlfriend is attributing a negative intention (lack of consideration) to her boyfriend's actions, rather than considering the possibility that he simply didn't know about her condition or her needs. She also seems to be assuming that he should be able to read her mind or recognize her physical state, even though she acknowledges that she can't speak when she has low blood sugar.

Furthermore, the fact that this has happened once before and she still expects her boyfriend to pick up on it without any explicit communication implies that she is holding him to an unrealistic standard. She is essentially expecting him to be omniscient and aware of her needs at all times, which is an unfair and unrealistic expectation.

In this scenario, the girlfriend's behavior and expectations can be seen as an instance of Naive Cynicism, as she is attributing negative intentions to her boyfriend's actions and expecting him to meet her needs without any explicit communication.

Naive Cynicism,gpt-4o,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"Naive cynicism refers to the tendency to interpret others' actions or beliefs in overly simplistic and negative ways, often assuming that they are driven by selfish or insincere motives. This concept is applied when people believe that others are acting in bad faith, even in the absence of compelling evidence to support such a conclusion.

In the example you provided, the boyfriend's criticism and anger towards Rachel Zegler seem to stem from superficial and subjective perceptions about her personality and appearance, rather than any substantive critique of her work or actions. His assumption that the speaker must also dislike Zegler because she identifies as a feminist reflects a projection of his biases and a dismissal of her independent opinions.

However, rather than showcasing an underlying cynicism about the motives of others, the specific grievances and reactions seem to reflect discomfort with certain social dynamics, particularly around gender and expressions of feminism. The boyfriend's perspective appears more aligned with discomfort towards feminist expressions, which he perceives in a negative light, rather than a cynical belief that Zegler's actions are insincere. The speaker, meanwhile, is interpreting the boyfriend’s rant as more than just superficial complaints, attributing it to deeper discomfort with women's independence and confidence.

In this situation, the boyfriend’s negative interpretation and dismissal of the speaker’s views seem more influenced by personal biases and traditional gender norms rather than naive cynicism. Therefore, his attitude and the surrounding context do not align cleanly with the concept of naive cynicism as it is typically defined.

Naive Cynicism,gpt-4o,"Ok, I (28f) went over to my boyfriend’s (25m) house for the first time (been dating about a month), and I had somehow never noticed his pillow situation before. When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he’s had the pillows and apparently he’s been using them since he was a kid.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

It involves expecting others to be more conscious of apparent problems or disadvantages than they might actually be, often leading to misinterpretations or mismatches in perceived intention and reality.

In this example, the person is concerned with their boyfriend's old pillows and expresses a desire not to use them, suggesting that they may not be clean. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a sentimental attachment to his pillows and chooses not to dispose of them, though he is open to the person bringing their own pillows. 

The situation primarily involves a difference in personal hygiene standards and sentimental values rather than any deeply cynical or naive assumptions about each other's intentions. The boyfriend's suggestion that it is a small issue for them to spend the night together is not necessarily a cynical view but might be a simple expression of emotional connection over material considerations. Meanwhile, the person's preference to avoid using the existing pillows is driven more by concern for cleanliness than any overly simplistic or self-serving assumption about the boyfriend's character or motivations.

Therefore, this specific situation does not seem to involve the concept of naive cynicism.

It suggests a simplistic and overly negative view of human nature, where individuals assume others are acting out of selfish motives without considering other possible explanations for their behavior.

The example provided primarily demonstrates a pattern of paranoid thinking, potentially indicative of a mental health disorder such as paranoid schizophrenia or another delusional disorder, rather than naive cynicism. The beliefs expressed involve a conviction of being watched and conspired against by undercover agents, guided by ""voices"" that inform the individual of hidden truths. The person's worldview is influenced by auditory hallucinations (voices) and delusional thoughts about secret organizations and alien beings. These symptoms point to a clinical delusion rather than a cynical interpretation of others' motivations.

For naive cynicism, the person would generally still be anchored in reality but overly cynical about the intentions of others based on realistic observations. In contrast, the provided narrative is characterized by complex delusional beliefs and auditory hallucinations disconnected from a reasonable interpretation of reality.

Therefore, this scenario does not represent naive cynicism, as the individual's assumptions about others' behaviors and motives stem from delusions and hallucinations rather than an overly cynical interpretation of real-world interactions.

Naive Cynicism,gpt-4o,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"Naive Cynicism is a psychological concept where individuals assume that others are mostly motivated by self-interest, even in situations where this is not necessarily the case.

In the given scenario, the husband initially agreed to help his wife by driving her car to Discount Tire (DT) as a favor since it seemed like a quick task. However, when it turned into a longer ordeal than expected, he decided to return home rather than stay and wait for the repair. His decision was based on his need to return to work and his belief that the situation wasn't as urgent as to justify staying longer, especially since his wife was already off work and could handle it herself.

The wife, on the other hand, becomes upset with the husband's decision to not wait at DT. However, there is no indication that the husband interpreted his wife's reaction in line with Naive Cynicism. He is aware of the context and reasons for his actions and does not attribute her reaction to self-serving motives. He tries explaining the situation to his wife, indicating that he sees it as a misunderstanding or communication issue rather than attributing her motives to self-interest.

However, this belief system is based on voices in the speaker's head, not on observations or rational analysis of other people's motivations. This is not an example of assuming everyone is selfish; it's more indicative of paranoid ideation possibly with hallucinations. Therefore, it's not an example of naive cynicism.

Naive Cynicism,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"Naive cynicism is the unwarranted belief that other people are more motivated by self-interest than they actually are. It involves assuming that others' behavior is driven by selfish motives even when there's no clear evidence to support that assumption.

In this scenario, the teacher immediately assumes the student is either trying to get out of class or exaggerating a headache. The teacher doubts the student's stated reason (a migraine) and instead attributes the request to a desire to avoid math class or general childish exaggeration. This reflects an assumption of self-serving behavior on the part of the child without sufficient basis. While it is true that children sometimes try to get out of class, the teacher's immediate discounting of the possibility that the student was genuinely ill fits the definition of naive cynicism.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

Naive Cynicism is when people assume others' disagreement with them must be due to bias, while viewing their own position as objective and rational.

The boyfriend demonstrates this in several ways:

1. He assumes Rachel Zegler's comments about Snow White must come from a place of disrespect rather than considering her genuine childhood experience.

2. When his girlfriend disagrees with his view, he claims she doesn't ""actually"" like Zegler and is only defending her because of feminism - dismissing her genuine opinion by attributing it to bias.

3. He presents his own intense negative reaction as rational and justified, while dismissing both Zegler's and his girlfriend's perspectives as ideologically motivated.

4. He seems unable to consider that his own strong negative reaction might stem from personal biases about how women should behave.

The example provided illustrates Naive Cynicism, a concept that refers to the tendency to attribute negative intentions or motives to individuals, particularly women, who challenge traditional gender roles or express confidence and independence. In this case, the boyfriend's criticism of Rachel Zegler is not solely about her acting or personality but rather about her confidence, political views, and expressiveness, which he perceives as threatening or unacceptable. His attempt to discredit Zegler and the feminist movement by dismissing her as ""not doing feminism right"" is an example of Naive Cynicism. The boyfriend's reaction to Zegler's confidence and independence, and his attempt to undermine her by questioning the speaker's own opinions, suggests a discomfort with women who assert themselves and take up space in a way that is not traditionally feminine.",,yes,

Naive Cynicism,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

The scenario you've described does not necessarily reflect Naive Cynicism. Naive Cynicism is a concept that refers to the belief that people are inherently selfish or untrustworthy, and that their actions are motivated by self-interest rather than concern for others. In this case, the teacher's initial assumption that the student might be trying to avoid math class or exaggerating his symptoms is not indicative of a deep-seated belief that people are inherently untrustworthy. Instead, it seems more like a momentary lapse in judgment, driven by the teacher's understanding of typical student behavior and the pressure of managing a classroom. The teacher's subsequent concern and regret after the student fainted suggest that she values the well-being of her students and was not acting out of cynicism. However, it's important to note that this is just one instance and a person's overall behavior and patterns of thought would be needed to definitively label it as Naive Cynicism.",,yes,

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me.

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

It involves projecting selfish motives onto others while believing oneself to be objective or fair.  

In this scenario, the boyfriend is not necessarily assuming that Rachel Zegler (or the girlfriend) is acting out of hidden selfish motives. Instead, he is:  
1. **Dismissing her authenticity** (e.g., claiming her confidence is ""smugness,"" framing her feminism as performative).  
2. **Projecting his discomfort** onto her behavior (e.g., interpreting her expressiveness as intentional provocation).  
3. **Denying the girlfriend’s independent opinion** (e.g., insisting she only defends Zegler because of feminism, not genuine agreement).  

These behaviors align more closely with **hostile sexism**, **tone policing**, or **patriarchal defensiveness** rather than Naive Cynicism. While there’s a hint of cynical thinking (e.g., ""you don’t actually like her""), the core issue is his reaction to women’s autonomy, not an assumption of ulterior motives.

Naive Cynicism is a cognitive bias where individuals assume that others' actions are more selfishly motivated than they actually are. It involves overestimating the role of self-interest in others' behavior while underestimating the sincerity or legitimacy of their reasons.

In this scenario:
1. The boyfriend's attachment to his old pillows is framed as ""sentimental,"" suggesting he values them for personal, non-selfish reasons (e.g., nostalgia, comfort).
2. The girlfriend interprets his refusal to get rid of the pillows as inconsiderate or unhygienic, implicitly assuming his prioritization of the pillows over her comfort is selfish or dismissive.
3. She also assumes his response (""I’d be sad to see that you’d choose something as small as pillows..."") is manipulative or guilt-tripping, rather than a genuine expression of his feelings.

While the girlfriend's concerns about hygiene are valid, her interpretation of his motives leans toward assuming selfishness or lack of care (e.g., ""gross pillowness""), without fully crediting his sentimental attachment. This aligns with Naive Cynicism, where she attributes his behavior to negative motives (e.g., indifference) rather than neutral or positive ones (e.g., emotional attachment).

However, the example isn't a perfect fit because her reaction is also rooted in a tangible issue (hygiene) rather than purely a misattribution of motives. Yet, the underlying dynamic—interpreting his actions as more selfish or dismissive than they might be—reflects the bias.

   Naive cynicism refers to the tendency of individuals to assume that others are more selfish, biased, or deceitful than they actually are, often without sufficient evidence. It involves an overly skeptical or distrustful view of others' motives, even in neutral or benign situations.  

2. **Analysis of the Example**:  
   - The text describes **paranoid delusions** (e.g., belief in undercover agents, hidden cameras, voices revealing secrets, aliens disguised as people) rather than a generalized distrust of others' motives.  
   - The beliefs are extreme, fixed, and detached from reality, which aligns more with **psychotic symptoms** (e.g., schizophrenia or delusional disorder) than with naive cynicism.  
   - Naive cynicism typically involves misattributing selfish intent in everyday social interactions (e.g., ""My coworker complimented me just to manipulate me""), not elaborate conspiracy theories involving aliens and secret organizations.  

3. **Key Differences**:  
   - Naive cynicism is a **cognitive bias** rooted in exaggerated skepticism, whereas the example reflects **delusional thinking** (a break from reality).  
   - The example lacks the ""naive"" quality—it’s not a simple overestimation of others' malice but a complex, self-reinforcing delusional system.

No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Naive Cynicism**, let's first define the concept and then analyze the scenario.

### What is Naive Cynicism?
Naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where individuals assume that others are more selfish, manipulative, or biased in their actions and intentions than they actually are. It involves attributing negative motives to others without sufficient evidence, often leading to misunderstandings or conflicts. This bias is ""naive"" because it oversimplifies others' behavior by assuming the worst, even when alternative, more benign explanations exist.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
1. **Wife's Perspective**:  
   - The wife may have interpreted her husband's reluctance to wait for the tire repair as a lack of care or willingness to help, especially since she was already done with work. Her reaction (""ruined everything,"" refusing to listen) suggests she attributed negative intent to his actions (e.g., prioritizing work over her needs).  
   - Her extreme reaction (e.g., ""I don't want to see you"") could stem from assuming his motives were selfish or dismissive, even though his explanation (needing to work, the tire not being an immediate danger) was reasonable.

2. **Husband's Perspective**:  
   - The husband initially agreed to a quick favor but balked when it became a longer commitment. He tried to explain the practical constraints (work, the tire's condition), but his wife dismissed his reasoning.  
   - His frustration (""you're acting like a child"") might reflect his own naive cynicism—assuming her insistence was unreasonable or manipulative rather than stemming from stress or concern about the car.

3. **Potential Naive Cynicism**:  
   - The wife's assumption that her husband was being neglectful or uncaring (despite his history of handling car chores and his immediate compliance) could be an example of naive cynicism. She attributed negative intent without considering his legitimate constraints.  
   - The husband's labeling of her behavior as childish might also reflect a cynical interpretation of her emotions (seeing them as irrational rather than as a reaction to perceived neglect).

### Conclusion:
The scenario does exhibit elements of naive cynicism, primarily from the wife's side. She assumed the worst about her husband's intentions without fully engaging with his explanation, leading to an exaggerated conflict. The husband's reaction, while frustrated, seems more focused on practicalities than attributing malice to her.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Naive Cynicism**, let's break down the concept and the situation:

### What is Naive Cynicism?
Naive Cynicism is a cognitive bias where an individual assumes that others are more selfish, manipulative, or deceitful than they actually are, often projecting negative motives onto their actions without sufficient evidence. It involves interpreting others' behavior through a distrustful lens, even when alternative, benign explanations exist.

### Analysis of the Example:
1. **Behavior Observed**: The girlfriend is private, avoids sharing personal details, and is protective of her phone. She redirects conversations to focus on her boyfriend rather than herself.  
2. **Boyfriend's Interpretation**: He assumes her secrecy is suspicious (""acts a little sus""), questions her feelings for him, and wonders if he’s ""not good enough."" He implies she might be hiding something (e.g., dishonesty or lack of interest).  
3. **Alternative Explanations**: Her behavior could stem from personality traits (introversion, past trauma, or cultural norms), a desire for autonomy, or discomfort with vulnerability. Her openness with Marie suggests she trusts selectively, not that she’s inherently deceitful.  

### Is This Naive Cynicism?
Yes, the boyfriend’s interpretation leans toward Naive Cynicism because:  
- He jumps to negative assumptions (distrust, hidden motives) without considering neutral or positive reasons for her behavior.  
- He projects his insecurities (""not good enough"") onto her actions, framing them as evidence of her lack of interest or potential deceit.  
- There’s no clear evidence of malice or dishonesty in her actions—just privacy preferences.  

While his feelings are valid, his conclusions reflect a cynical overinterpretation of her behavior.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"This example does appear to be an instance of **Naive Cynicism**. Here's why:

Naive Cynicism is a cognitive bias where individuals assume that others' actions are more self-interested, dishonest, or less genuine than they actually are. In this case, the teacher assumed the 8-year-old student was either trying to get out of math class (due to poor performance) or exaggerating a headache, rather than genuinely experiencing a migraine. The teacher's skepticism led them to dismiss the student's request for help, which resulted in a serious consequence (the student fainting). The teacher's initial reasoning reflects an overly cynical interpretation of the student's motives, underestimating the validity of his claim.

The teacher's assumption that the child was lying or exaggerating, rather than considering the possibility of a genuine medical issue, aligns with the definition of Naive Cynicism. The outcome (the student fainting) underscores the harm that can arise from this bias.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Naive Cynicism**, let's first define the concept and then analyze the situation.

### What is Naive Cynicism?
Naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where individuals assume that others' actions are more selfishly motivated than they actually are. It involves overestimating the extent to which others are acting out of self-interest or malice, while underestimating situational factors or innocent explanations for their behavior. 

### Analysis of the Example:
In the given scenario, the girlfriend interprets her boyfriend's behavior (not helping her make food when she had low blood sugar) as **inconsiderate**—a selfish or negligent act. She attributes his inaction to a lack of care or thoughtfulness, despite the fact that he genuinely didn’t notice her distress (she was walking normally and didn’t communicate her need). 

This aligns with naive cynicism because:
1. **She assumes negative intent**: She believes he *should have known* and that his failure to act reflects inconsiderateness, rather than attributing it to a genuine lack of awareness or her own lack of communication.
2. **She underestimates situational factors**: She dismisses the possibility that he simply didn’t perceive her distress (due to her appearing normal) and instead jumps to a negative judgment about his character.
3. **She expects mind-reading**: Her expectation that he should ""just know"" her needs without explicit communication is unrealistic and reflects a cynical assumption about his motives (e.g., ""he doesn’t care enough to pay attention"").

### Counterpoints:
- If the girlfriend had acknowledged that her boyfriend might not have noticed and that her own communication was lacking, this would *not* be naive cynicism. But her insistence that he *should have known* and her labeling him as ""inconsiderate"" reflects the bias.
- The boyfriend’s perspective—that he couldn’t tell and would have helped if he knew—highlights the mismatch between her cynical interpretation and the reality of the situation.

### Conclusion:
This is an example of naive cynicism because the girlfriend attributes her boyfriend’s behavior to a negative trait (inconsiderateness) while overlooking the situational explanation (his lack of awareness due to her lack of communication).

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the example given is an instance of Naive Cynicism. Let me start by recalling what Naive Cynicism is. From what I remember, it's a cognitive bias where people assume that others' actions are more self-interested or have more negative motives than they actually do. It's like when someone thinks that another person did something just to benefit themselves, without considering other possible reasons.

Looking at the scenario here, the boyfriend is ranting about Rachel Zegler. He's criticizing her for things like her facial expressions, being full of herself, laughing too loud, etc. The person (the one telling the story) feels that his anger isn't really about Rachel but about his discomfort with confident women who speak their minds. Then he accuses her of only defending Rachel because of feminism, implying that her own opinions aren't genuine but are just aligning with feminist views. 

Naive Cynicism would involve the boyfriend attributing negative motives to Rachel's actions. For example, if he thinks she's being smug or full of herself, he's assuming her behavior is driven by self-importance rather than genuine confidence or expression. Additionally, when he tells the girlfriend that she doesn't actually like Rachel and is only defending her because of feminism, he's dismissing her genuine opinions as being motivated by a group ideology (feminism) rather than her own thoughts. That's attributing a self-interested or insincere motive to her defense, which fits Naive Cynicism.

But wait, is there another concept here? Maybe like hostile sexism or something else related to patriarchy? The user mentions patriarchal nonsense. But the question is specifically about Naive Cynicism. So even if there's sexism involved, the key is whether the boyfriend is making cynical attributions about others' motives.

The boyfriend's assertion that the girlfriend doesn't truly like Rachel and is just following feminism suggests he believes her motives are not genuine. He's assuming her stance is not authentic but rather a product of aligning with a movement. That's Naive Cynicism because he's attributing her actions to a more self-serving or group-serving motive (to support feminism) rather than her actual personal opinion.

Also, his critique of Rachel Zegler might involve assuming her confidence and expressiveness are signs of being ""full of herself,"" which again is attributing negative intent or self-centered motives to her behavior. Instead of seeing her actions as genuine self-expression, he interprets them as arrogance or smugness, which are negative traits. That could be part of Naive Cynicism.

So putting it all together, the boyfriend's behavior includes dismissing the girlfriend's genuine opinions by attributing them to feminist alignment (assuming her motives are not her own) and attributing negative motives to Rachel's behavior. Both of these aspects fit Naive Cynicism. Therefore, the answer is yes.
</think>

The scenario described does exhibit elements of **Naive Cynicism**, a cognitive bias where individuals attribute others' actions or beliefs to self-serving, insincere, or overly negative motives rather than genuine intentions. Here’s how it applies:

1. **Attributing Negative Motives to Rachel Zegler**: The boyfriend interprets Rachel’s confidence, expressiveness, and critiques of *Snow White* as signs of arrogance (“too smug,” “full of herself”) rather than authentic self-expression or valid opinion. This reflects Naive Cynicism because he assumes her behavior stems from self-aggrandizement or disrespect (“disrespectful to classics”) instead of acknowledging her perspective as legitimate or context-dependent (e.g., a childhood fear of a film).

2. **Dismissing the Girlfriend’s Opinions**: When the boyfriend claims the girlfriend “doesn’t actually like” Rachel and is “only defending her because she’s feminist,” he invalidates her genuine stance by attributing it to performative alignment with feminism. This assumes her motivations are not personal or sincere but instead driven by a desire to conform to a movement—a cynical interpretation of her autonomy and reasoning.

3. **Reducing Feminism to a PR Campaign**: His critique that Rachel’s personality should “make feminism cute and likable for dudes” implies he views feminist expression as calculated or manipulative rather than authentic. This again reflects Naive Cynicism, as he frames her behavior as strategic (serving an agenda) rather than organic or self-determined.

While the situation also involves patriarchal attitudes (e.g., discomfort with women who “take up space”), the core issue aligns with Naive Cynicism due to the repeated attribution of insincere, self-serving motives to both Rachel’s actions and the girlfriend’s defense of her. The boyfriend’s inability to engage with their perspectives as genuine—instead dismissing them as performative or agenda-driven—exemplifies this bias.

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Ok, I (28f) went over to my boyfriend’s (25m) house for the first time (been dating about a month), and I had somehow never noticed his pillow situation before. When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he’s had the pillows and apparently he’s been using them since he was a kid.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

Thoughts? I feel like I can’t even kiss him or anything while we’re sleeping because I don’t want him to get his gross pillowness all over me and my clean pillows. 😂",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of naive cynicism. Hmm. First, I need to remember what naive cynicism actually means. From what I recall, naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where people assume that others have more egocentric motives than they actually do. It's like when someone interprets another person's actions as being self-serving or having hidden negative intentions, without considering other possible explanations.

So looking at the example here: the girlfriend (28f) goes to her boyfriend's house and notices his old pillows. She comments on their age, and he says he's had them since childhood. She doesn't want to sleep on them because they're old (maybe she thinks they're dirty or unhygienic) and decides to go home. The boyfriend responds by saying he's sad she's letting pillows get in the way but understands. Later, she suggests bringing her own pillows and asks him to get rid of his, but he refuses because they're sentimental.

Now, the question is whether the girlfriend's actions or thoughts here are an example of naive cynicism. Let's break it down. The girlfriend assumes the pillows are gross and doesn't want them near her. She might think the boyfriend is being inconsiderate by keeping old pillows, perhaps not caring about hygiene. But does she attribute his behavior to self-centered motives? Let me think. The boyfriend's reason is sentimentality, not something selfish. He's keeping them for emotional reasons. If the girlfriend assumes that he's keeping them for a selfish reason (like not caring about her comfort) rather than sentimentality, that could be naive cynicism. But in the story, he actually tells her they're sentimental, so she's aware of his stated reason. Her concern is about cleanliness, not doubting his motives. She doesn't accuse him of being selfish; she just finds the pillows gross. 

Alternatively, if she thought he was lying about sentimentality and actually keeping them for some other self-serving reason, that would be naive cynicism. But the example doesn't mention that. She's more focused on the hygiene aspect. So maybe her assumption is about the pillows being dirty, not about the boyfriend's intentions. Therefore, it might not be naive cynicism. Naive cynicism is more about attributing self-centered motives to others. Here, she's not doubting his motives (he says sentimental, she doesn't challenge that), she's just uncomfortable with the pillows themselves. So perhaps this isn't an example of naive cynicism. Instead, it's more of a personal preference or hygiene concern. Unless there's an underlying assumption that he's not considering her needs, but even then, he's offering to let her bring her own pillow. So she might think he's not prioritizing her comfort, but he's compromising by allowing her pillows. Hmm. But naive cynicism would involve her assuming his motives are more self-centered than they are. Since his stated motive is sentimentality, and she's not disputing that, just disliking the pillows, maybe it's not. Therefore, the answer is probably no.
</think>

The example provided does not clearly illustrate **naive cynicism**. Naive cynicism involves assuming others act out of self-interest or hidden negative motives, even when alternative explanations (e.g., neutral or benevolent intentions) are plausible. In this scenario, the girlfriend’s concern centers on hygiene and discomfort with the pillows’ age and condition, not on attributing self-serving motives to her boyfriend. She acknowledges his stated reason for keeping the pillows (sentimentality) and does not accuse him of selfishness or ulterior motives. Instead, her focus is on her own preference for cleanliness and reluctance to use the pillows. The boyfriend, meanwhile, openly communicates his sentimental attachment and compromises by allowing her to bring her own pillow. There is no evidence of the girlfriend misinterpreting his intentions as egocentric; rather, the conflict arises from differing priorities (hygiene vs. sentimental value).

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I know they’re undercover agents working for an secret organization for god knows how long now. My voices in my head told me everything, I connected all the dots. & everything makes perfect sense. They’ve been gathering Intel on me then sending it to their secret organization that works for a national organization (FBI,CIA,NSA)

I know undercover agents are watching me & following me when I leave the house & they have hidden cameras around my apartment building to watch when I leave my apartment. The voices are telling me all the details as I speak, so I know it’s true. The voices told me everything I needed to know, I know they’re in cahoots with some organization under cover. I know ppl are watching me via undercover agents/ hidden cameras & they are all undercover.

They’re trying to gradually extract info from me cuz I know where the aliens are, that info I ain’t disclosing to them whatever secret organization they’re with I know they’ve already have a ton of Intel on me as it is. My voices told me where aliens are but I ain’t gonna disclose that info cuz I know ppl are watching my every move via hidden cameras & undercover agents. Plus they’re all undercover agents.

My voices also said that some aliens are walking among us disguised as normal ppl. Another reason why is when I called them out about the fact that they’re all undercover agents & what their true motives about acquiring where the aliens were they removed me from the group chat they knew they were caught so they removed me completely to maintain their cover.

I know they’re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn’t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of. I was freaking out for real, I was like I ain’t say shit to them. I know that there are aliens in disguise walking among us my voices told me.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this example is an instance of naive cynicism. First, I need to remember what naive cynicism actually means. From what I recall, naive cynicism is a psychological concept where a person assumes that others have more negative or self-serving motives than they actually do. It's like when someone thinks that others are acting out of selfish reasons even without evidence. But wait, the example here is someone believing that undercover agents are spying on them, aliens are involved, and they're getting information from voices in their head.

Hmm. The person here is clearly paranoid, believing in a conspiracy involving multiple agencies and hidden cameras. They mention voices telling them these things, which makes me think of something like schizophrenia or a delusional disorder. Naive cynicism is more about everyday assumptions of others' intentions, not necessarily delusions or paranoid beliefs. But wait, maybe there's a connection. The person does think that others (agents, organizations) are acting against them with hidden motives. But naive cynicism is a general bias, not a clinical condition. The example here seems more like clinical paranoia or delusions rather than the everyday judgment errors associated with naive cynicism.

Another point: naive cynicism often involves projecting one's own biases onto others. For example, if someone is dishonest, they might think others are dishonest too. But in this case, the person isn't just projecting; they have elaborate beliefs supported by auditory hallucinations (voices) and specific delusions about aliens and government agencies. The belief system here is more fixed and detached from reality, which sounds more like a mental health issue than the cognitive bias of naive cynicism.

So, putting it all together, naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where someone assumes others have self-serving motives without sufficient evidence, but it's not the same as delusional thinking. The example given includes delusions of persecution, auditory hallucinations, and complex conspiracy theories. Therefore, this probably isn't an example of naive cynicism but rather a manifestation of a psychotic disorder. The key difference is the presence of hallucinations and fixed false beliefs versus a general distrust based on biased assumptions.
</think>

The example provided does not align with the concept of **Naive Cynicism**. Naive cynicism refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overattribute self-serving or malicious motives to others’ actions without sufficient evidence, often projecting their own biases onto ambiguous situations. It typically involves everyday distrust, such as assuming a coworker’s helpfulness is insincere or that a friend’s compliment hides jealousy. These are generalized, non-delusional assumptions about others’ intentions.

In contrast, the example describes **paranoid delusions** and **psychotic symptoms**, including auditory hallucinations (“voices in my head”), fixed false beliefs about surveillance (hidden cameras, undercover agents), and elaborate conspiracy theories involving aliens and government agencies. These beliefs are not grounded in reality and are characteristic of conditions like schizophrenia or delusional disorder. The individual’s conviction that external forces (e.g., secret organizations) are actively conspiring against them, combined with hallucinations, exceeds the scope of naive cynicism, which lacks such rigid, fantastical, and sensory-supported elements.

Furthermore, naive cynicism does not involve hallucinations or systematized delusions. It is a milder, more common cognitive bias, whereas the example reflects severe psychopathology. The reliance on “voices” as a source of truth and the specificity of the delusions (aliens, FBI/CIA collaboration) indicate a break from reality inconsistent with naive cynicism’s framework of biased social judgments.

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the example given is an instance of Naive Cynicism. First, I need to recall what Naive Cynicism means. From what I remember, Naive Cynicism is a psychological concept where people expect others to act more selfishly than they actually do. It's like assuming that someone's actions are motivated by self-interest even when there's no evidence for that. People exhibiting this bias might interpret others' behavior in a negative light, thinking they have ulterior motives.

Now, looking at the example provided. The situation is about a husband and wife conflict over a favor that turned into a longer task. The husband agreed to take the car to get the tire fixed, expecting it to be a quick 15-minute task. However, when the repair took longer, he wanted to leave and go back to work, leading to an argument. The wife got upset, and there was a lot of miscommunication and conflict.

The question is whether the husband's actions or the wife's reactions demonstrate Naive Cynicism. Let's break it down. The husband initially agreed to help, but when the situation changed, he prioritized his work. The wife might have thought he was being inconsiderate or not willing to help enough. Alternatively, maybe the husband thought the wife was being unreasonable by expecting him to stay longer despite his work commitments.

Naive Cynicism would involve one party assuming the other's actions are driven by selfishness. For example, if the wife believed the husband was making excuses to avoid helping her (selfish motive), that could be Naive Cynicism. Similarly, if the husband thought the wife was trying to inconvenience him on purpose, that might also fit. 

Looking at the wife's reaction: she gets very upset, sends angry texts, refuses to listen, and says he ruined everything. She might be assuming that he didn't want to help her out of laziness or lack of care. The husband, on the other hand, tried to explain the situation but she wouldn't listen. If her reaction is based on the assumption that he's acting out of selfishness rather than genuine work obligations, that could be Naive Cynicism.

Alternatively, the husband's perspective: he might think his wife is being unreasonable and demanding, perhaps attributing her actions to selfishness (like not caring about his work). But in the scenario, he's more focused on explaining the practical issues (the tire not being flat, the time constraints). His actions seem more about time management than attributing her motives as selfish.

The key here is whether one party is attributing selfish motives without evidence. The wife's reaction seems emotional, but is it based on a cynical assumption about the husband's intentions? She might believe he's prioritizing work over her needs without considering his actual constraints. If she assumes his refusal to wait is due to not caring about her, that's a cynical take. However, the husband's account doesn't explicitly state her reasoning, just her anger. 

The husband's own actions don't seem to reflect Naive Cynicism. He agreed to help initially, and his issue was the time extension. He didn't accuse her of trying to manipulate him or anything; he just wanted to manage his work. The wife's reaction, though, might stem from an assumption that he's not willing to help her when needed, which could be a cynical view if there's no basis for it. But perhaps she's just frustrated rather than making a cynical assumption about his motives.

Wait, but Naive Cynicism is about the expectation that others will act selfishly. If the wife is interpreting his actions as selfish (e.g., he doesn't care enough to help), that's Naive Cynicism. The husband's perspective: he might think she's being inconsiderate of his work, but that's more about her not valuing his time rather than assuming she's acting out of selfishness. 

The example's main conflict arises from a miscommunication and differing priorities. The wife might have expected the husband to prioritize her car issue over work, while he felt he needed to get back. If she attributes his leaving to not caring (selfishness), that's Naive Cynicism. However, without explicit evidence of her making that assumption (rather than just being angry about the situation), it's a bit ambiguous. The husband's description says she got upset and refused to listen, but we don't know her internal reasoning. The story is told from his perspective, so it's hard to say for sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the husband's expectation that the favor would be quick and his frustration when it took longer isn't Naive Cynicism. He didn't assume the wife was being selfish; he was reacting to the situation changing. The wife's reaction might involve some cynical thinking if she believes he's being intentionally unhelpful. But again, the narrative doesn't explicitly state her attributions. 

In conclusion, the presence of Naive Cynicism would depend on the underlying attributions of selfish motives. If the wife assumes the husband's actions are due to selfishness (without considering his work constraints), then yes. However, since the story is from the husband's viewpoint and he doesn't elaborate on her exact thoughts, it's possible but not certain. Alternatively, if the husband assumed the wife was being unreasonable out of selfishness (but he seems to be explaining her actions as being upset rather than attributing motives), that might not fit. 

Given the information, the wife's reaction might be an example of Naive Cynicism if she's attributing his actions to selfishness. But without explicit evidence, it's a judgment call. However, based on her statements like ""ruined everything"" and refusing to listen, she might be assuming negative intent, which aligns with Naive Cynicism. So the answer would be yes.
</think>

The example provided involves a conflict where the husband initially agrees to a quick favor but faces unexpected complications, leading to a disagreement with his wife. To determine if this is an instance of **Naive Cynicism**, we must assess whether either party assumes selfish motives in the other without sufficient evidence. Naive Cynicism involves attributing others' actions to self-interest or negative intent, even when alternative explanations (e.g., situational constraints) are plausible.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Husband's Perspective**:  
   The husband agreed to help with the tire repair, expecting a 15-minute task. When the situation escalated (requiring a longer wait), he prioritized his work obligations. His actions suggest a focus on practical constraints (time, work deadlines) rather than attributing selfish motives to his wife. He attempted to explain the tire’s condition and logistical issues but was met with resistance. There is no clear indication that he assumed his wife’s request was driven by selfishness; instead, he perceived her reaction as emotional and unreasonable.

2. **Wife’s Reaction**:  
   The wife became upset, refused to listen to his explanation, and made hyperbolic statements (e.g., “ruined everything,” “I don’t want to see you”). Her anger could stem from frustration with the situation, but her refusal to engage with his explanation suggests she may have interpreted his actions as a lack of care or willingness to prioritize her needs. If she assumed his reluctance to stay at DT was motivated by selfishness (e.g., laziness, indifference) rather than legitimate work constraints, this aligns with Naive Cynicism. However, the narrative (told from the husband’s perspective) does not explicitly confirm her internal reasoning, leaving some ambiguity.

3. **Contextual Factors**:  
   - The husband had previously handled tire maintenance and communicated the need for a DT visit, indicating no neglect.  
   - The wife’s insistence on him staying at DT, despite her workday ending and his ongoing obligations, might reflect a mismatch in priorities rather than cynical assumptions.  
   - Her extreme reaction (“ruined everything”) could imply she attributed malicious intent to his actions, but it might also reflect heightened emotions unrelated to cynical thinking.

### Conclusion:  
While the wife’s behavior hints at potential Naive Cynicism (e.g., assuming selfish intent without considering situational factors), the lack of explicit evidence about her internal thought process makes this interpretation speculative. The husband’s actions do not exhibit Naive Cynicism, as he focused on practical explanations rather than attributing malice to his wife. The conflict appears more rooted in miscommunication and emotional reactivity than in a clear-cut case of Naive Cynicism.

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests. But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of Naive Cynicism. Hmm, first, I need to remember what Naive Cynicism actually means. From what I recall, Naive Cynicism is a type of cognitive bias where people expect others to have more egocentric motives than they actually do. It's like assuming that someone else's actions are driven by self-interest or negative intentions without considering other possible reasons.

Looking at the example here, the guy is worried about his girlfriend's secretive behavior. She's very private, doesn't use social media, diverts conversations to him, and is super possessive of her phone. He's feeling insecure, thinking she might not like him or that he's not good enough. He suspects she's hiding something, maybe even cheating, because she's so guarded, especially around him but not her best friend Marie.

So, does his assumption that her secrecy is due to negative intentions (like hiding something bad) fit into Naive Cynicism? Let's break it down. Naive Cynicism would involve him attributing her actions to self-centered motives without considering other explanations. For instance, maybe she's just a private person, has trust issues, or past experiences that make her guard her privacy. But he jumps to the conclusion that she's being suspicious, possibly leading him to doubt her feelings and his own worth.

Wait, but Naive Cynicism is more about assuming others are acting out of self-interest. If he thinks she's hiding something because she's not into him or is cheating, that's attributing negative intent. But is there another angle? Maybe he's overestimating her self-focused motives (like she's hiding something for her own benefit) rather than considering alternative reasons that aren't about her being self-centered. Alternatively, if he's projecting his own insecurities, that might be a different bias.

Another point: the girlfriend's behavior could be due to her personality (private person) or maybe she values privacy highly. The boyfriend's interpretation that it's about him (she doesn't like him, he's not good enough) could be an example of Naive Cynicism if he's assuming her actions are self-interested (like hiding something from him for her own reasons) without evidence. But if he's just insecure and making it about himself without assuming her motives, maybe it's more like the fundamental attribution error or projection.

Wait, the Fundamental Attribution Error is when you attribute others' actions to their character rather than situational factors. Here, he's attributing her secretiveness to her hiding something (character) rather than considering situational factors like her being private. But Naive Cynicism specifically involves the expectation of self-interest. So if he thinks she's acting this way because she's, say, hiding another relationship (selfish motive), that would fit. But if he's just insecure and thinking she doesn't like him, maybe that's more personal insecurity than Naive Cynicism.

Hmm. The key here is whether he's assuming her actions are driven by self-centered motives. His thoughts that she's being ""sus"" (suspicious), possessive of her phone, and that he's not good enough suggest he thinks she's hiding something negative, possibly related to him. If he's assuming she's acting in a self-interested way (e.g., cheating, lying) without considering other possibilities like privacy preferences, then that's Naive Cynicism.

So, in this case, the boyfriend is interpreting her secretive behavior as indicative of negative intent (like hiding something bad), which he attributes to her self-interest (maybe she's cheating, not committed). He's not considering alternative explanations that don't involve her having self-centered motives. Therefore, this might be an example of Naive Cynicism.
</think>

The example provided does not clearly align with the concept of Naive Cynicism. Naive Cynicism specifically refers to the tendency to assume others are acting out of self-interest or egocentric motives, often overestimating the role of such intentions while underestimating situational or alternative explanations. In this scenario, the boyfriend is experiencing insecurity and anxiety due to his girlfriend’s secretive behavior, such as guarding her phone and avoiding sharing personal details. However, his concerns stem more from personal insecurity (e.g., feeling ""not good enough"") and uncertainty about her feelings, rather than a specific assumption that her actions are driven by self-centered motives. 

While he interprets her behavior as suspicious (""acts a little sus""), his focus is on potential relational issues (e.g., doubts about her loyalty or affection) rather than attributing her actions to inherent selfishness or manipulative intent. His anxiety could also reflect projection of his own insecurities or a fundamental attribution error (attributing her behavior to her character rather than situational factors, like her personality or past experiences). For this to qualify as Naive Cynicism, there would need to be a clearer emphasis on assuming her secrecy is rooted in self-serving goals (e.g., exploiting him, manipulating the relationship for personal gain), which is not explicitly stated here. Instead, his distress appears rooted in uncertainty and self-doubt rather than a cynical expectation of her motives.

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"
Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out if this situation is an example of Naive Cynicism. So, first, what's Naive Cynicism? From what I remember, it's a cognitive bias where someone assumes that other people's actions are more self-interested or have more negative motives than they actually do. Like, when you think someone is acting out of selfish reasons without considering that they might have genuine or more benign intentions.

In the example given, the teacher is recounting an incident where a student asked to go to the nurse because of a migraine. The teacher assumed the student was either trying to get out of class (since it's math, which he's not good at) or exaggerating a headache. The teacher's initial reaction was skepticism about the student's motives, leading her to deny immediate help. Then the student fainted, showing that the migraine was real and serious. The parent later gets angry, and the teacher is questioning if they were wrong.

So, applying Naive Cynicism here: The teacher assumed the student's request was driven by a desire to avoid math class rather than a genuine medical issue. She doubted the student's honesty, attributing his actions to ulterior motives (avoiding work) instead of taking his claim at face value. That fits with the definition. Naive Cynicism involves overestimating the role of self-interest in others' behavior. The teacher didn't consider the possibility that the student was telling the truth, leading to a negative outcome. 

But wait, there's another angle. The teacher mentions the student is 8 and might not know what a migraine is. Maybe she thought he was confused about his symptoms. However, even if that's part of her reasoning, the primary assumption seems to be that the child was trying to get out of class. The key point is the attribution of the child's motives as dishonest without sufficient evidence, which aligns with Naive Cynicism. 

So, the teacher's initial assumption was a cynical take on the student's intentions, leading her to dismiss his genuine need. Therefore, this scenario does look like an instance of Naive Cynicism.
</think>

The scenario described does appear to be an instance of **Naive Cynicism**. Naive Cynicism involves assuming that others’ actions are driven primarily by self-interest or deceit rather than genuine motives, often without sufficient justification. Here, the teacher’s skepticism toward the student’s request to visit the nurse exemplifies this bias. 

The teacher explicitly attributes the student’s request to two self-serving motives: (1) avoiding math class (due to poor performance) or (2) exaggerating a minor headache. This assumption dismisses the possibility of a legitimate medical issue (e.g., a migraine) despite the student explicitly naming one. The teacher’s reasoning centers on distrust of the child’s honesty, even questioning whether an 8-year-old could accurately understand or describe a migraine. By framing the situation as a choice between “lying to skip class” and “overreacting,” the teacher defaults to cynicism about the student’s intentions rather than considering the validity of his claim. 

The subsequent fainting incident underscores the harm of this bias, as the teacher’s assumption delayed appropriate medical attention. While the teacher’s mention of the student’s age might suggest uncertainty about his ability to self-diagnose, the primary rationale—doubting the child’s sincerity—aligns with Naive Cynicism. The bias here lies in overestimating the likelihood of manipulative intent while underestimating the plausibility of genuine need.

Naive Cynicism,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"
Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether this scenario is an example of Naive Cynicism. Hmm. First, I need to recall what Naive Cynicism means. From what I remember, Naive Cynicism is a cognitive bias where people assume that others have more negative, self-serving motives in their actions than they actually do. It's like when someone interprets another person's behavior as being intentionally harmful or selfish without considering other explanations, such as situational factors or simple misunderstandings.

Now, looking at the example provided. The girlfriend is upset because the person didn't help her make food when she had low blood sugar. She accuses him of being inconsiderate. The person here (the boyfriend) didn't realize she needed help because she was acting normally, and he says he couldn't tell. The girlfriend thinks he should have known without her communicating because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She's mad, and this has happened before.

So, does this fit Naive Cynicism? Let's break it down. The girlfriend attributes the boyfriend's lack of help to him being inconsiderate. She assumes his inaction was due to a negative trait (being inconsiderate) rather than considering that he might not have noticed her condition. The boyfriend, on the other hand, says he didn't pick up on any clues and thought she was okay. He's suggesting that she should have communicated her needs, implying that his failure wasn't due to malice but a lack of information.

Naive Cynicism would involve the girlfriend making a negative assumption about the boyfriend's intentions. She's interpreting his behavior as inconsiderate (a negative motive) instead of considering that he might not have realized her state (a situational factor). However, wait—she might not be assuming his motive but rather his awareness. If she believes he should have known despite her not communicating, maybe she's expecting him to mind-read, which could be a different issue. But the key here is the attribution of motive. If she thinks he didn't help because he's inconsiderate (a negative trait), that's Naive Cynicism. If she's upset because he didn't notice, but not necessarily attributing it to a negative motive, maybe not. 

Wait, the example says she called him inconsiderate. So she's directly attributing his inaction to a character flaw (inconsiderate), implying that he chose not to help, which is a negative motive. But in reality, he didn't notice. So she's assuming his action (or inaction) was due to a negative trait rather than a situational factor (not knowing). That fits Naive Cynicism. She's interpreting his behavior through a cynical lens, assuming the worst about his intentions without considering that he might not have been aware.

But another angle: maybe she's not attributing his actions to a negative motive but expecting him to notice based on past experience. Since it's happened before, she might think he should have learned. But even so, her accusation of being inconsiderate suggests she's assigning a negative motive. Naive Cynicism is about the assumption of negative intent. So if she's saying he's inconsiderate (implying he intentionally didn't help), that's Naive Cynicism. If she's just frustrated he didn't notice, that's different. But the key is the attribution of intent. Since she called him inconsiderate, which is a character judgment implying intentional neglect, that's a sign of Naive Cynicism.
</think>

The scenario described can be analyzed through the lens of Naive Cynicism, which involves attributing others' actions to negative motives (e.g., selfishness, inconsiderateness) while overlooking situational factors or plausible benign explanations. Here, the girlfriend accuses the boyfriend of being ""inconsiderate"" for not helping her when she had low blood sugar, assuming his inaction stemmed from a lack of care or intentional neglect. However, the boyfriend explains that he did not recognize her distress because she appeared to behave normally and did not communicate her needs explicitly. 

Naive Cynicism is evident in the girlfriend’s interpretation of his behavior: she attributes his failure to act to a negative trait (""inconsiderate"") rather than considering situational factors, such as his inability to perceive her physical state or her own lack of communication. Her expectation that he ""should have known"" without clear signals—despite her acknowledgment that she struggles to communicate during such episodes—reflects an assumption of negative intent (e.g., ""he chose not to help"") rather than giving him the benefit of the doubt (e.g., ""he didn’t realize""). While her frustration is understandable, her framing of the issue as a character flaw (rather than a miscommunication or situational oversight) aligns with the core idea of Naive Cynicism.

Naive Cynicism,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The concept of Naive Cynicism involves a simplistic and often pessimistic view of human behavior, often attributing actions to the worst possible motives without considering more nuanced or complex explanations. In the example provided, the individual's boyfriend appears to be projecting his discomfort with a confident, expressive woman onto the person of Rachel Zegler, using her as a target for his frustrations. He seems to be engaging in a form of Naive Cynicism by attributing her behavior to negative motives (e.g., being ""full of herself,"" ""too smug,"" ""thinks she's smart"") without considering that her actions might be genuine expressions of her personality or beliefs.

The boyfriend's comments about feminism and his insistence that the narrator must share his negative view of Rachel Zegler also suggest a simplistic and cynical view of complex social issues and personal opinions. His reaction appears to be more about his own discomfort with strong, independent women and the concept of feminism than about Rachel Zegler's actual behavior or character.

In conclusion, the example does illustrate elements of Naive Cynicism, as the boyfriend's reactions and attributions seem to be overly simplistic and cynical, lacking a deeper understanding of the nuances of personality, social dynamics, and personal opinions.

Naive Cynicism,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.

Naive Cynicism is a term often used to describe an overly pessimistic or distrustful view of the world, usually based on limited experience or a lack of understanding of human nature.

But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"The example provided does not directly illustrate the concept of Naive Cynicism. Naive Cynicism refers to a type of thinking where an individual assumes that others are motivated by self-interest and that they cannot be trusted. It involves a general distrust of people's intentions and a belief that everyone is out for themselves.

In the scenario described, the individual is experiencing feelings of insecurity and confusion due to their girlfriend's secretive behavior. This situation could lead to a development of Naive Cynicism if the individual begins to assume that their girlfriend's secretive behavior is indicative of her having ulterior motives or being untrustworthy. However, based on the information provided, it seems more like a case of personal boundaries and privacy issues rather than a manifestation of Naive Cynicism.

The individual is struggling with feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty about their relationship, which is a natural response to a lack of communication and transparency. It is important to address these concerns directly with the girlfriend to understand her reasons for maintaining privacy and to establish a more open and trusting relationship.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"The example provided does not illustrate Naive Cynicism. Naive Cynicism is a concept that involves a person holding a pessimistic view of human nature, often assuming that others are motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. In the scenario described, the teacher initially assumed the student might be trying to avoid class or exaggerating his symptoms, which could be seen as a form of skepticism or wariness rather than outright cynicism. The teacher's actions, however, were intended to address the student's needs while also managing the classroom environment effectively. The teacher's response to the student's fainting and subsequent actions demonstrate a concern for the student's well-being, which contradicts the notion of naive cynicism.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"The example you provided does not appear to be an instance of Naive Cynicism. Naive Cynicism is a concept that refers to the belief that people are inherently selfish and that any kind of cooperation or kindness is motivated by self-interest. In the situation you described, your girlfriend is expressing frustration because she feels you should have been able to recognize her low blood sugar and help her without her having to ask. This situation seems more related to communication issues and expectations within a relationship rather than a display of Naive Cynicism.

Normalcy Bias,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive"".",0,"The concept of Normalcy Bias refers to the tendency of people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or unusual event occurring, and to believe that things will continue to function as they normally do, even when faced with evidence to the contrary. In this context, Normalcy Bias can manifest as a reluctance to acknowledge or prepare for potential problems, and instead, to downplay or dismiss concerns.

In the given example, the author, a teacher, is concerned about students wearing ""fake"" glasses, which can be distracting, disrespectful, and even pose a safety risk (as in the case of the broken frames with sharp edges). However, when the author reports these issues to the administration, they are met with a dismissive response, essentially telling them to ignore the problem and not be ""so sensitive.""

The administration's response can be seen as an instance of Normalcy Bias. By downplaying the author's concerns and telling them that the kids are ""just having fun,"" the administration is underestimating the potential risks and disruptions caused by the students' behavior. They are also failing to consider the potential consequences of allowing students to wear non-functional medical devices, such as glasses with sharp edges or obstructed vision.

Furthermore, the administration's reliance on the school's dress code, which does not explicitly address the use of non-functional medical devices, demonstrates a lack of preparedness and flexibility in responding to unusual situations. By rigidly adhering to the dress code and failing to consider the broader implications of the students' behavior, the administration is exhibiting a Normalcy Bias, assuming that things will continue to function as they normally do, without acknowledging the potential risks and disruptions.

Therefore, the administration's response to the author's concerns can be seen as an instance of Normalcy Bias, as they are underestimating the potential problems and failing to take adequate measures to address the issues.

This bias can lead individuals to downplay or deny the possibility of an unexpected event, even when warning signs are present.

In the given example, the individual experiences an uncomfortable and unexpected encounter with a group of 11th graders who stare at them and make comments about their leather jacket. The person feels uneasy and unsure about how to react, and they eventually walk away from the situation.

The Normalcy Bias might be relevant in this scenario if the individual had initially underestimated the potential for an uncomfortable or confrontational interaction with the 11th graders. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the person is more surprised and unsettled by the unexpected nature of the encounter, rather than having underestimated the likelihood of such an event occurring.

The individual's reaction to the situation, as described, is more focused on their emotional response to the unexpected stare and comments, rather than a failure to anticipate the possibility of an unusual event. They acknowledge feeling uncomfortable and unsure about how to react, which suggests that they are aware of the unusual nature of the encounter.

Furthermore, the person's self-reflection, as expressed in the statement ""maybe im overreacting,"" indicates that they are considering the possibility that their reaction might be excessive, but they are still trying to make sense of the unexpected encounter. This self-awareness and willingness to question their own reaction suggests that they are not exhibiting a strong Normalcy Bias, as they are not downplaying or denying the unusual nature of the event.

In conclusion, while the individual in the example does experience an unexpected and uncomfortable encounter, their reaction and self-reflection do not strongly suggest a Normalcy Bias. The person's focus is more on processing their emotional response to the unexpected event, rather than underestimating the likelihood of such an event occurring.

This bias can lead individuals to downplay or ignore warning signs, and to fail to prepare for or respond adequately to unexpected events.

In the given example, the teacher's initial response to the student's complaint of a migraine can be seen as an instance of Normalcy Bias. The teacher assumed that the student was either trying to get out of class or was overexaggerating, and did not take the student's symptoms seriously. This assumption was based on the teacher's expectation of how an 8-year-old student would typically behave, and a belief that the student's complaint was unlikely to be a genuine medical issue.

The teacher's decision to tell the student to drink water and sit back down, rather than taking immediate action to assess the student's condition or seek medical attention, was influenced by this bias. The teacher was relying on their normal experience of students trying to avoid class or exaggerating minor complaints, rather than considering the possibility that the student was actually experiencing a serious medical issue.

The fact that the student subsequently fainted and was found to be genuinely unwell suggests that the teacher's initial assessment was incorrect, and that the student's complaint should have been taken more seriously. The teacher's reflection on their actions, and their growing concern that they may have been in the wrong, suggests that they are beginning to recognize the role that Normalcy Bias played in their decision-making.

Therefore, the teacher's initial response to the student's complaint can be seen as an instance of Normalcy Bias, as it was influenced by an assumption that things would continue to function as they normally do, and a failure to consider the possibility of an unusual or unexpected event occurring.

Normalcy Bias,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"The concept of Normalcy Bias refers to the tendency for people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or unusual event occurring, and to believe that things will continue as they normally do, even when faced with evidence to the contrary. In this context, Normalcy Bias would involve a person downplaying or denying the severity of a situation, or expecting that things will return to normal without taking adequate action to address the problem.

In the scenario described, the boyfriend's behavior does not appear to be an instance of Normalcy Bias. Instead, his actions seem to be driven by a combination of factors, including frustration, pride, and a desire to avoid feeling embarrassed or vulnerable. His refusal to let his girlfriend spot him, his insistence that he cannot back out of the parking space, and his angry outburst when she suggests seeking help from the owner of a neighboring car, all suggest that he is more concerned with maintaining his ego and avoiding feelings of inadequacy than with finding a practical solution to the problem.

The boyfriend's behavior is also characterized by a lack of self-awareness and a tendency to blame others for his own mistakes. When his girlfriend points out that he ruined the evening, he shifts the blame to her, claiming that she should not have spoken to him while he was trying to find a solution. This lack of accountability and tendency to deflect criticism are not typical of Normalcy Bias, which would involve a more passive or optimistic attitude towards the situation.

Furthermore, the boyfriend's actions are not driven by a belief that things will return to normal without effort, but rather by a desire to avoid feeling embarrassed or humiliated. His behavior is more indicative of a personality trait or emotional issue, rather than a cognitive bias like Normalcy Bias.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"The concept of Normalcy Bias refers to the tendency for people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or emergency situation, and to assume that everything will return to normal shortly.

Despite hearing the girl yelp in pain and noticing that she has a noticeable limp after the fall, the author chooses not to intervene or ask if she is okay. Instead, he goes back to minding his own business, stating that the girl is ""not my kid, not my problem.""

The author's behavior can be seen as an instance of Normalcy Bias, as he appears to be downplaying the severity of the situation and assuming that the girl will be fine without any assistance. He fails to consider the potential consequences of the girl's injury, such as the possibility of a serious back injury or the need for medical attention. By not taking any action to help the girl or warn her about the wet ground, the author is essentially assuming that everything will return to normal and that the girl will not suffer any long-term effects from the fall.

Furthermore, the author's justification for not intervening, ""not my kid, not my problem,"" suggests a lack of empathy and a failure to consider the well-being of others. This attitude is reinforced by his response to his wife's concerns, where he repeats his phrase and shows no willingness to take responsibility for his inaction.

In contrast, the author's wife exhibits a more empathetic and responsible attitude, as she checks on the girl to make sure she is okay and suggests that the author should have warned her about the wet ground. Her comment about how they would want someone to help their own child in a similar situation highlights the importance of considering the well-being of others, even if they are not directly related to us.

In conclusion, the author's behavior in this scenario can be seen as an instance of Normalcy Bias, as he downplays the severity of the situation and fails to take necessary actions to help the girl. His lack of empathy and failure to consider the well-being of others are also noteworthy, and his wife's concerns and actions serve as a contrast to his inaction.

The Normalcy Bias might be a contributing factor to the speaker's failure to recognize their girlfriend's condition, but it's not the primary issue.

It is commonly referred to in contexts where people fail to prepare for or respond to crises like earthquakes, floods, or economic crashes because they assume things will continue to be normal.

In the provided scenario, the issue revolves around the teacher's perception that students wearing non-corrective or prop glasses is distracting and potentially unsafe. This concern is not about ignoring or underestimating potential disasters, but rather it is about addressing immediate behavioral and safety issues within a school setting.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious.

Normalcy Bias,gpt-4o,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot.

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Normalcy Bias is a psychological state where individuals underestimate the possibility of a disaster occurring or its possible effects, which causes them to be unprepared for an emergency. It typically involves situations where people fail to react to warnings or signs of potential danger because they assume things will continue as normal.

In this scenario, the boyfriend's reaction to the parking situation is more about personal frustration, stubbornness, and perhaps pride rather than an underestimation of a potential threat or disaster. His refusal to let someone spot him or provide assistance, along with the emotional outburst, indicates issues with handling stress or perceived challenges, but it does not imply a failure to recognize or respond to an imminent emergency or disaster. There is no indication that he or anyone involved is underestimating or ignoring a real or potential danger in favor of normalcy.

Therefore, while the boyfriend's behavior may seem irrational or overly emotional, it does not fit the concept of Normalcy Bias.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"Normalcy Bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to underestimate both the likelihood of a disaster and its potential effects, causing them to maintain normalcy in their behavior and underreact when they notice warning signs of a potential crisis. This can result in individuals ignoring real and present dangers because they believe things will continue as they always have, even when faced with evidence to the contrary.

In this scenario, the individual observed the girl slipping and falling, which is an incident that could suggest a minor injury rather than a disaster or crisis that would activate Normalcy Bias. The person's reaction of not checking on the girl was based on indifference due to the child not being his responsibility, rather than a belief that no harm could or did come from the situation. The primary factor here is the personal detachment and apathy stemming from her not being his child, rather than a cognitive bias assuming that the situation is normal and non-threatening.

Therefore, this situation is not an instance of Normalcy Bias but rather a question of personal responsibility and empathy toward others in potential distress.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"Normalcy Bias refers to a cognitive bias wherein people underestimate the likelihood or possible impact of a disaster or catastrophic event, often based on the assumption that things will continue to function as they always have. It involves the inclination to interpret warnings or signs of danger as less serious than they actually are, leading individuals to neglect preparations or ignore necessary actions to mitigate risks.

In the scenario described, the situation involves a misunderstanding or communication issue in a relationship, particularly around the girlfriend's low blood sugar episode. The boyfriend didn't recognize the signs that the girlfriend needed help, despite a previous similar incident. However, this situation is more about interpersonal dynamics and communication in a relationship rather than a failure to acknowledge a potential disaster or heightened risk situation.

The key elements of Normalcy Bias are not present here, as there isn't an underlying catastrophic event being underestimated by the boyfriend. Rather, it is about recognizing signs of a medical condition and understanding the need for improved communication within the relationship. The scenario reflects a gap in awareness or communication rather than a cognitive bias associated with downplaying a crisis situation.

In the provided scenario, the individual experienced an uncomfortable encounter with older students. While the situation was certainly unsettling, it doesn't necessarily suggest a normalcy bias. The individual *did* recognize the unusual nature of the staring and whispering and felt uncomfortable because of it. The individual acknowledges the event was ""out of the blue"" and expresses that they are unsure if they are overreacting - this uncertainty indicates a level of recognition that the situation was not normal. If the individual had dismissed the event entirely, assuming that the students were just being friendly and that there was no reason to feel uneasy, that *could* suggest normalcy bias.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water.

It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks.

Normalcy Bias refers to a mental state where people underestimate the likelihood or potential impact of a disaster or crisis because they assume things will continue to function as they normally do. It often leads people to ignore warning signs of impending disasters or fail to prepare for emergencies.

What's described here is more of a case of emotional dysregulation, pride/ego issues, and potentially controlling behavior on the boyfriend's part. His reaction stems from:
1. Embarrassment about needing help
2. Stubbornness in refusing assistance
3. Anger management issues
4. Possible anxiety about driving in tight spaces

The situation doesn't involve any denial of a dangerous situation or clinging to normalcy in the face of disaster - rather, it's an interpersonal conflict stemming from emotional and behavioral issues.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"This isn't an example of Normalcy Bias, which is the tendency to believe that things will continue to function as they normally have and to underestimate both the likelihood and potential consequences of a disaster or disruption occurring.

In this case, the person is exhibiting callous indifference and a lack of basic human empathy, rather than denying or minimizing a potential threat or emergency. They fully acknowledged and saw what happened but simply chose not to care or help because it wasn't their responsibility. This is more an example of the bystander effect or simple selfish behavior rather than Normalcy Bias.

Normalcy Bias would be more like if the person convinced themselves that the fall wasn't serious or that everything must be fine because falls like that ""usually aren't a big deal,"" despite evidence to the contrary.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"This situation doesn't appear to be an example of Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias refers to a mental state that causes people to underestimate both the possibility of a disaster occurring and its possible effects. It's when people believe things will continue to function as they normally have, even when faced with clear signs of an impending crisis or disaster.

In this case, what's being described is more of a communication issue and different expectations between partners. The boyfriend wasn't refusing to believe something bad could happen or maintaining that everything was normal despite clear warning signs. Instead, he simply failed to recognize his girlfriend's symptoms of low blood sugar, which is different from Normalcy Bias.

Normalcy Bias,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive"".",0," ANSWER: Yes

The situation you described is an instance of the Normalcy Bias, a psychological phenomenon where people fail to prepare for or react to a disaster because they assume that things will return to normal. In this case, the normalcy is the expectation that students will wear functional glasses if they choose to wear them, and that they will not use non-functional or decorative glasses as a distraction from schoolwork.

You, as a person who relies on glasses for your vision, have a clear understanding of the importance of functional glasses and the potential dangers of non-functional ones. However, the administration's response, which ignores the potential risks and instead focuses on the students' ""choices in apparel"" and their perceived fun, demonstrates a failure to recognize the significance of the issue. This failure to recognize the potential risks and the dismissive attitude towards your concerns is a classic example of normalcy bias.

Additionally, the students' behavior of wearing non-functional glasses and using them as a distraction also demonstrates a form of normalcy bias, as they seem to believe that wearing glasses, even if they are non-functional, is an acceptable behavior and that they can use them as a tool for distraction without consequences.

Overall, the situation you described is an example of normalcy bias, as both the students and the administration are failing to recognize the potential risks and consequences of non-functional glasses and are instead operating under the assumption that things will return to normal and that there is no need for concern.",,yes,

In this example, the individual exhibits signs of Normalcy Bias. This cognitive bias causes people to underestimate the potential severity of a situation and to expect things to return to normal quickly. In this case, the individual was so accustomed to the normalcy of school and interacting with their peers that they initially dismissed the strange and uncomfortable behavior of the two students. They continued to engage in their usual activities, such as talking to a friend and walking to their next classroom, despite feeling uneasy. It was only when they were left behind and the two students continued to stare at them with a disturbing look that they began to feel uncomfortable. However, they still tried to brush it off by saying hi and continued to walk away, assuming that everything would return to normal.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The situation described in the example demonstrates Normalcy Bias, as the teacher assumed that the student's complaint of a migraine was an exaggeration or an attempt to avoid classwork, rather than a genuine medical issue. This assumption led the teacher to respond in a way that may have been inappropriate for the situation, and potentially endangered the student's health. Normalcy Bias is the tendency for people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or emergency, and to assume that things will continue as usual, even when they should be taking action to prepare for or respond to the situation. In this case, the teacher's normalcy bias caused them to dismiss the student's symptoms as insignificant, rather than taking them seriously and taking appropriate action.",,yes,

**Normalcy Bias** refers to the tendency of people to underestimate or dismiss the possibility of a disaster or significant disruption, often assuming that things will continue as they normally do despite warning signs. It involves a cognitive resistance to accepting abnormal or threatening situations, leading to delayed or inadequate responses.  

In the given scenario, the issue revolves around personal feelings about students wearing non-functional glasses, perceived disrespect, and administrative dismissal of concerns—not an underestimation of a crisis or refusal to acknowledge a threat due to an assumption of normalcy. The frustration expressed is more about social norms, personal history with glasses, and workplace dynamics rather than a failure to recognize or respond to an impending danger or disruption.

**Normalcy Bias** refers to the tendency of individuals to underestimate or dismiss potential dangers or threats, assuming that things will continue as they normally do, even in the face of warning signs or unusual events. It often involves downplaying risks or refusing to acknowledge abnormal situations because they disrupt one's sense of routine or familiarity.

In your scenario, you were acutely aware of the unusual and uncomfortable behavior of the 11th graders, and you reacted by feeling disturbed and choosing to leave. You did not dismiss their actions as ""normal"" or ignore the threat (perceived or real). Instead, you recognized the abnormality of the situation and responded accordingly. Your discomfort and decision to walk away suggest that you were not underestimating or rationalizing their behavior—which would be hallmarks of Normalcy Bias.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"This example does **not** clearly demonstrate **Normalcy Bias**. Here's why:

**Normalcy Bias** refers to the tendency of people to underestimate or dismiss the possibility of a disaster or severe outcome, assuming that things will continue as they normally do, even when signs of danger or abnormality are present. It often involves downplaying threats due to a subconscious belief that ""everything will be fine"" because it usually is. 

In this scenario, the teacher's assumption that the student was exaggerating or trying to skip class was based on:  
1. **Past behavior** (the student struggling in math),  
2. **Skepticism about the child's self-diagnosis** (doubting an 8-year-old could accurately identify a migraine), and  
3. **A strategy to test the validity of the claim** (waiting to see if symptoms persisted).  

This reflects a **judgment error** or **misplaced skepticism** rather than Normalcy Bias. The teacher wasn't ignoring a clear threat or disaster signal (e.g., dismissing a fire alarm as a drill); they were making a (flawed) assessment of the child's motives and condition based on contextual factors. Normalcy Bias would apply more to situations where obvious risks are ignored due to a refusal to accept abnormal circumstances (e.g., refusing to evacuate during a flood because ""it's never been that bad before"").  

Here, the teacher's mistake was underestimating the **severity of the child's condition**, not assuming that a crisis couldn't happen because ""things are always normal.""

He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"This scenario does **not** appear to be an instance of **Normalcy Bias**. 

**Normalcy Bias** refers to a cognitive bias where individuals underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster or unusual event, assuming that things will continue as they normally do. It often manifests as a refusal to acknowledge or react to emergencies or abnormal situations because the person believes ""everything will be fine"" or ""this can't be happening."" Examples include ignoring evacuation orders during a hurricane or downplaying early warning signs of a crisis.

In this case, the boyfriend's behavior is more consistent with **frustration, poor emotional regulation, and possibly controlling or manipulative tendencies** rather than Normalcy Bias. His reaction—refusing help, escalating anger, blaming others, and creating unnecessary conflict—does not stem from an inability to recognize an abnormal or dangerous situation. Instead, it seems rooted in personal insecurity (e.g., not wanting to be seen as incapable), stubbornness, or a pattern of sabotaging enjoyable moments. 

The situation was not an emergency or a novel threat that he dismissed due to an assumption of normalcy; it was a mundane parking difficulty that he catastrophized and mismanaged. His refusal to accept solutions (like being spotted) further contradicts the idea of Normalcy Bias, as he was hyper-focused on the problem rather than dismissing it.

Thus, this is not an example of Normalcy Bias.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Normalcy Bias**, let's first define the concept:  

**Normalcy Bias** is a cognitive bias where individuals underestimate the possibility of a disaster or adverse event occurring, assuming that things will continue to function normally despite signs of danger or disruption. It often leads to inaction or delayed response in emergencies because people rationalize that the situation isn’t as serious as it appears.  

In this scenario:  
- The narrator witnesses a young girl slip, fall, and sustain an injury (noticeable limp).  
- Despite hearing her yelp and seeing her struggle, he rationalizes that she is ""not his kid"" and therefore not his responsibility.  
- He assumes she is fine (or that it's not serious enough to intervene) despite clear signs of distress.  

While his inaction could also be attributed to **diffusion of responsibility** (assuming someone else will help) or **apathy**, there is an element of **Normalcy Bias** in his assumption that the fall wasn’t severe enough to warrant intervention—he downplays the potential seriousness of the injury because he expects things to be ""normal"" (i.e., the girl will be fine without his help).  

However, the primary driver of his behavior seems to be indifference (""not my kid, not my problem"") rather than an outright denial of the event's significance. Normalcy Bias typically involves a stronger underestimation of risk due to an assumption of stability, whereas here, the narrator simply doesn’t care enough to act.  

Thus, while there are *some* aspects of Normalcy Bias in his dismissal of the situation, his reasoning aligns more closely with **moral disengagement** or **apathy** than with a true underestimation of the event's severity.

Normalcy Bias,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"
Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Normalcy Bias**, let's first define the concept and then analyze the situation.

### What is Normalcy Bias?
Normalcy Bias is a cognitive bias where individuals underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster or unusual event, assuming that things will continue to function as they normally do, even in the face of clear warning signs. It often leads to delayed reactions or inaction because the person fails to recognize or accept the severity of a situation due to their expectation of ""normal"" conditions.

### Analysis of the Example:
In the given scenario:
1. The girlfriend was quiet and unresponsive, which was unusual behavior for her (a potential warning sign).
2. She was walking around normally, which led the boyfriend to assume everything was fine (relying on the expectation of ""normal"" behavior).
3. She had a history of low blood sugar episodes, but the boyfriend didn't pick up on the cues this time, possibly because her outward behavior (walking normally) seemed typical.

The boyfriend's failure to recognize the signs of her low blood sugar could be interpreted as a form of Normalcy Bias. He assumed her behavior was normal (or close enough to normal) despite subtle cues (quietness, not responding), leading him to miss the underlying issue. His expectation of her usual behavior overrode his ability to detect the abnormality.

However, it's worth noting that Normalcy Bias is more commonly applied to larger-scale disasters or crises (e.g., ignoring evacuation orders during a hurricane because ""it's never been bad before""). In interpersonal contexts like this, it might be more accurate to describe this as a failure of situational awareness or communication rather than a strict example of Normalcy Bias. That said, the underlying mechanism—assuming normality despite signs to the contrary—is similar.

### Conclusion:
While the scenario shares some traits with Normalcy Bias (underestimating an unusual situation due to expectations of normalcy), it's not a textbook example. The primary issue here seems to be miscommunication and lack of explicit cues rather than a cognitive bias in the classic sense.

ANSWER: No",no,yes,0.0
Normalcy Bias,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive"".",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example provided is an instance of the Normalcy Bias. I need to first make sure I understand what Normalcy Bias is. From what I remember, Normalcy Bias refers to a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or adverse event happening, assuming that things will function normally despite signs indicating otherwise. It's like when people ignore warnings about hurricanes because they think ""it won't happen here"" or ""it won't be that bad.""

Now, looking at the example given. The person (F52) works in an elementary school and notices students wearing fake glasses. She finds this distracting and disrespectful, especially since she's had a history with needing glasses and being bullied. She reports the issue to the administration, but they dismiss her concerns, saying the kids are just having fun and there's no dress code against it.

Wait, how does this relate to Normalcy Bias? The admin is downplaying her concerns, maybe thinking that even though the glasses could be dangerous (like the broken frames with sharp edges), they don't see it as a real problem. They might be assuming that since fake glasses aren't a typical issue addressed in the dress code, everything is normal and there's no need to take action. That fits with Normalcy Bias because they're ignoring potential risks (like injury from broken frames) by sticking to the existing norms (dress code doesn't mention it, so it's okay).

But wait, another angle: the admin's dismissal might be more about not wanting to address a new trend rather than underestimating a disaster. The Normalcy Bias is usually about disasters or serious threats. In this case, the threat is minor (possible injury from broken frames, distraction in class), but the admin's response is to maintain the status quo (""don't be so sensitive"") and not acknowledge the potential risks. So maybe it's a form of Normalcy Bias because they're assuming that since it's not in the dress code, it's not a problem, thus underestimating the possible negative outcomes.

Alternatively, maybe it's not Normalcy Bias. The admin could be dismissing her concerns due to different reasons, like not wanting to enforce new rules or thinking the issue isn't significant. But the key here is whether their dismissal is based on an assumption that things will remain normal despite the signs. The broken glasses with sharp edges do pose a safety risk, but the admin ignores that, perhaps believing that such incidents won't happen (normalcy) even when there's a clear hazard. So that would align with Normalcy Bias.

Another thought: the teacher's own reaction might be influenced by her past experiences, but the question is about the admin's response. The admin's refusal to act, despite the potential danger, because they don't see it as a problem (since it's not in the dress code) might be an example of Normalcy Bias. They are downplaying the risk based on their existing framework (the dress code), assuming that everything will be fine because it's not explicitly prohibited. Hence, they underestimate the likelihood of harm.
</think>

The example provided does not directly align with the concept of Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias typically involves underestimating the likelihood or severity of a crisis or disaster, often by clinging to the assumption that ""things will continue as usual"" despite clear warning signs. It is characterized by a refusal to acknowledge or prepare for potential threats due to an overreliance on the status quo. 

In this scenario, the school administration dismisses the teacher's concerns about students wearing non-functional or unsafe glasses. However, their reasoning is not rooted in denying a looming threat or disaster. Instead, they are prioritizing the absence of explicit dress code rules against non-medical accessories and framing the issue as harmless fun. Their dismissal stems from a lack of policy alignment and a judgment about the triviality of the concern (""don't be so sensitive"") rather than an assumption that a serious risk (e.g., injury from broken frames) is unlikely to occur. While their response may reflect poor judgment or negligence, it does not exemplify the cognitive distortion inherent in Normalcy Bias, which specifically involves minimizing catastrophic risks during crises. The situation here revolves more around policy enforcement, subjective interpretations of respect, and safety oversight, not a failure to recognize or act on a disaster scenario.

Okay, let me think about this. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of Normalcy Bias. First, I need to recall what Normalcy Bias is. From what I remember, Normalcy Bias is a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or danger occurring, assuming that things will function as they usually do. It's like when someone ignores warning signs because they believe everything will stay normal.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person was at school, got left behind by their class, encountered some older students staring at them, which made them uncomfortable. They tried to say hi, but the others kept staring, leading them to leave. The person felt uneasy and wondered if they were overreacting.

Wait, does this situation involve downplaying a threat or assuming things are normal despite signs of danger? The person noticed the staring, felt uncomfortable, and decided to walk away. They even mention feeling like they might be overreacting. But Normalcy Bias would be more about ignoring the signs, not reacting to them. For example, if they thought the staring wasn't a big deal and stayed despite the discomfort, that might be Normalcy Bias. But here, they actually took action by leaving. The person's reaction seems more like anxiety or social discomfort rather than denying a potential threat. They recognized the situation as uncomfortable and acted, even if they later question their reaction. So maybe this isn't Normalcy Bias. Instead, it's more about social anxiety or uncertainty about others' intentions. Normalcy Bias would involve not acknowledging the possible danger, like staying in a risky situation because they assume nothing bad will happen. Since the person left, they didn't ignore the threat. Therefore, this example doesn't fit Normalcy Bias.
</think>

The example provided does not clearly illustrate Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias typically involves underestimating or dismissing potential threats or dangers by assuming that things will continue as they normally do, even in the face of unusual or alarming signs. In this scenario, the individual notices the unsettling behavior of the older students (prolonged staring, whispering, laughter) and actively responds by leaving the situation due to discomfort. Their reaction—acknowledging the discomfort and removing themselves—suggests awareness of the unusual nature of the encounter rather than denial or minimization of it. While the person questions whether they are overreacting, this reflects self-doubt or social anxiety rather than a refusal to accept that something abnormal or threatening might be occurring. Normalcy Bias would manifest more as ignoring the situation entirely, rationalizing it as harmless despite clear signs of risk, or failing to act due to an assumption that ""everything is fine."" Here, the individual’s actions align more with caution or discomfort in a socially ambiguous moment, not with a bias toward normalizing danger.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out if this situation is an example of Normalcy Bias. First, I need to remember what Normalcy Bias is. From what I recall, Normalcy Bias is a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or its effects, assuming that things will function normally despite signs indicating otherwise. It's like when someone ignores a fire alarm because they think it's just a drill, leading to dangerous inaction.

In the given example, the teacher had a student who complained about a migraine and asked to go to the nurse. The teacher assumed the student was either trying to skip class or exaggerating a headache. The teacher's response was to have the student drink water and stay seated, planning to check again after the lesson. Then the student fainted, leading to a serious situation where the parent got angry.

So, applying the concept here: the teacher downplayed the student's complaint, thinking it's not serious (either lying or exaggerating). The teacher's assumption that the situation was normal (kid trying to get out of class) led to not taking immediate action. This inaction resulted in the student fainting. The teacher's reasoning was based on past experiences (kids exaggerating) and the subject (math, which the student isn't good at), leading to dismissal of the real problem.

Normalcy Bias would involve the teacher believing that things would continue as normal (no real emergency) despite the student's report of a migraine. The teacher's failure to recognize the potential severity (migraine leading to fainting) and acting as if everything was normal fits here. Instead of considering the possibility that the student was genuinely ill, the teacher stuck to the normal routine (wait until break, check later), which aligns with Normalcy Bias.

Another angle: the teacher's assumption that the student didn't know what a migraine was (since he's 8) might be part of the bias. Underestimating the child's ability to accurately report symptoms, perhaps. But does that tie directly to Normalcy Bias? Maybe. The key is the underestimation of the threat or seriousness, leading to inaction when action was needed.

So yes, this seems to fit. The teacher dismissed the signs of a real problem, assuming the situation was normal (kid faking or exaggerating), leading to a failure to act appropriately, which resulted in the student's health deteriorating. Therefore, this is an instance of Normalcy Bias.
</think>

The scenario described involves a teacher dismissing a student's report of a migraine, assuming the child was either attempting to avoid class or exaggerating a minor issue. The teacher’s reasoning relied on preconceived notions about children’s behavior (e.g., faking illness to skip subjects they struggle with) and skepticism about the student’s ability to accurately describe a migraine. By delaying action—insisting the student wait until after the lesson to visit the nurse—the teacher prioritized maintaining normal classroom routines over addressing the potential seriousness of the situation. This dismissal of the student’s distress, coupled with the assumption that no urgent intervention was needed, aligns with **Normalcy Bias**. 

Normalcy Bias manifests when individuals underestimate threats or emergencies, often rationalizing away warning signs to preserve a sense of routine. Here, the teacher minimized the possibility of a genuine medical issue, interpreting the situation through a lens of normalcy (e.g., ""kids exaggerate,"" ""he just wants to skip math""). The subsequent fainting incident underscores the consequences of this bias: the teacher’s inaction exacerbated the student’s condition, leading to a preventable escalation. The parent’s outrage further highlights the failure to recognize and respond to the severity of the situation, which stemmed from the teacher’s adherence to assumptions of normalcy despite clear indicators of a problem.

Normalcy Bias,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if the example given is an instance of Normalcy Bias. First, I need to remember what Normalcy Bias is. From what I recall, Normalcy Bias is a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or adverse event happening, assuming that things will function as they normally do. It's like when someone refuses to evacuate during a hurricane because they think it won't be that bad, based on their past experiences where nothing bad happened.

Now, looking at the scenario here. The boyfriend is trying to back out of a parking spot but gets really frustrated. He insists he can't do it even though the truck behind him was there when he parked. He's panicking, yelling, not listening to the girlfriend's suggestions to help. He even locks her in the car and refuses help from others. Eventually, when she does spot him, they get out quickly. 

Normalcy Bias would involve him denying the reality of the situation, maybe thinking that the truck wasn't really a problem or that it would just go away. But in this case, he's actually overestimating the difficulty (the truck was already there, so maybe he thought he could get out easily when he parked, but now he's stuck). Wait, no, the problem is that he's not accepting the current reality. But wait, Normalcy Bias is more about downplaying risks or not considering them because you assume everything is normal. Here, the boyfriend is perhaps reacting with excessive stress and not accepting the solution (letting his girlfriend spot him) because of his ego or embarrassment. 

Alternatively, maybe he's stuck in the belief that the situation is impossible (even though it's not), which could be a form of cognitive bias. But Normalcy Bias is specifically about assuming things will stay normal despite signs of danger. For example, if there was a fire and he refused to leave because he thought it's not a big deal. Here, the situation isn't a disaster scenario. He's stuck in a parking spot, but there's a feasible solution (being spotted). His refusal to accept help might be more about pride or anxiety rather than a failure to recognize the severity of the situation. 

Wait, another angle: Maybe he's so used to being able to park easily that he can't adjust when the situation changes. But according to the story, the truck was there when he parked. So he should have known it was possible to get out. But he's panicking and not thinking clearly. That doesn't exactly fit Normalcy Bias. Instead, it might be more about emotional regulation or stubbornness. 

Normalcy Bias is more about denial of a crisis. The key here is whether he's underestimating the problem because he expects things to be normal. But in the story, he's overestimating the problem, thinking he can't get out when actually he can. So maybe it's the opposite. He's not in denial; he's catastrophizing. So maybe not Normalcy Bias. 

Therefore, the answer would be no. The example doesn't demonstrate Normalcy Bias but rather a different issue, like poor anger management or inability to accept help due to ego.
</think>

The scenario described does not align with the concept of Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias refers to the tendency to underestimate or dismiss potential dangers or disruptions, often by assuming that familiar routines or conditions will persist despite evidence to the contrary. It typically manifests as denial or inaction during crises (e.g., refusing to evacuate during a disaster because ""things will be fine""). 

In this case, the boyfriend is not downplaying a threat or assuming normality; instead, he is overreacting to a perceived problem (difficulty exiting a parking spot) that he believes is insurmountable, despite the girlfriend offering viable solutions (spotting him, seeking help). His behavior—anger, frustration, refusal to accept assistance—stems from emotional dysregulation, embarrassment, or pride rather than a failure to recognize the reality of the situation. He acknowledges the problem but reacts irrationally, prioritizing his ego over practical resolutions. 

Normalcy Bias would apply if, for example, he had ignored the truck’s presence entirely, assuming he could exit the spot effortlessly as he always had, leading to an accident. Here, his exaggerated response and rejection of help are better explained by emotional factors or cognitive distortions like catastrophizing, not Normalcy Bias.

So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this situation is an example of the normalcy bias. First, I need to remember what normalcy bias actually means. From what I recall, normalcy bias is a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or danger occurring, or its effects. They assume that things will function normally despite signs indicating otherwise. It's like when people ignore evacuation orders during a hurricane because they can't believe it will be that bad.

Now, looking at the scenario here. The person (the husband) saw a girl slip and fall, hurt herself, and then didn't help or even check on her. His reasoning was ""not my kid, not my problem."" His wife is upset because he didn't offer help or warn the girl about the wet ground. 

Normalcy bias would involve the man perhaps downplaying the severity of the situation. Maybe he thought, ""Oh, she's fine, people fall all the time, nothing serious will happen."" But in this case, his reasoning isn't about underestimating the danger. Instead, he's actively choosing not to help because he doesn't feel responsible. His lack of action seems more about apathy or a refusal to take responsibility rather than a cognitive bias where he believes everything is normal despite evidence to the contrary.

Wait, but could there be an element of normalcy bias here? Let's think. The man might have assumed that since falls happen, especially in a city like New York, there's no real danger here. Even though the girl was limping, he might have thought it's not a big deal. But his stated reason is not caring because she's not his kid, not necessarily that he thought she wasn't hurt. The wife's point about wanting someone to help their own kid in a similar situation suggests empathy, which he's lacking here. 

Normalcy bias is more about denial of the risk, not about lack of empathy. The man's behavior is more about indifference or a lack of social responsibility rather than an underestimation of the situation's severity. So this might not be normalcy bias. Instead, it's a failure to act due to personal disinterest, not a cognitive bias where he misjudges the danger.
</think>

The scenario described does not align with the concept of Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias refers to a cognitive tendency to underestimate or dismiss the likelihood or severity of a crisis, often leading individuals to believe that ""everything will be fine"" despite clear signs of danger. This bias involves a failure to recognize or respond to threats due to an assumption that normal conditions will persist, even when evidence suggests otherwise (e.g., ignoring evacuation warnings during a disaster). 

In the given example, the man’s inaction stems not from a misjudgment of the situation’s risks but from a deliberate refusal to engage due to apathy and a lack of perceived responsibility (""not my kid, not my problem""). He acknowledges the fall and the resulting limp but chooses not to act, prioritizing indifference over concern. His wife’s criticism centers on his moral failure to show empathy or communal responsibility, not on a cognitive underestimation of harm. Normalcy Bias would require him to downplay the injury’s seriousness (e.g., assuming the limp was trivial or temporary), but his reasoning explicitly rejects care based on unrelated personal disinterest rather than a distorted perception of the event’s severity.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of normalcy bias. First, I need to recall what normalcy bias is. From what I remember, normalcy bias is a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or adverse event happening, assuming things will continue as normal. It's like when people ignore warnings because they can't imagine a crisis occurring.

Now looking at the example given. The situation is between the user and his girlfriend. She got upset because he didn't help her make food when she had low blood sugar. The user says he couldn't tell she was unwell because she was acting normally. She argues he should have known without her telling him. The user is wondering if he's at fault here.

So, normalcy bias would come into play if he assumed everything was normal despite signs of a problem. But in this case, the girlfriend was acting normally (walking around, not communicating her issue). The user didn't notice any signs because she didn't show obvious symptoms. He might have assumed she was okay because she wasn't displaying clear indicators of distress. But does that fit normalcy bias?

Wait, normalcy bias is more about expecting things to stay normal in the face of potential danger. For example, not evacuating during a hurricane warning because you think it won't be that bad. Here, the issue is about not recognizing a partner's medical condition (low blood sugar) without explicit communication. The user's assumption that she was fine because she looked normal might be related to normalcy bias if he dismissed possible signs. But if there were no signs, maybe it's more about communication issues rather than a cognitive bias.

Alternatively, maybe the user's assumption that she's okay because she's acting normally, despite her having a condition that sometimes requires help, could be a form of normalcy bias. Like, he expects her to be fine each time, even though she's had this issue before. But the key here is whether he downplayed the possibility because of expecting normalcy. Since she had a prior incident, maybe he should have been more vigilant, but he didn't notice any signs. The girlfriend's expectation that he should know without communication complicates it. 

Normalcy bias is about underestimating the likelihood of a negative event. If the user didn't consider that she might be having low blood sugar again because he thought things would be normal, that could be normalcy bias. But if he just didn't pick up on cues because there were none, then it's not. The girlfriend's behavior (acting normal) made him think she was okay. So his assumption of normalcy led him to not act. But is that the same as normalcy bias? Maybe. Alternatively, it's a communication problem where she expects him to notice without cues. 

I think the core of normalcy bias is the underestimation of risk due to a belief in normal conditions. Here, the user might have assumed she was fine (normal) despite her history, leading him to not take action. But the example isn't about a disaster or major event; it's a personal interaction. However, the concept can apply to personal situations where someone ignores potential problems. Since he knew she had low blood sugar before, perhaps he should have considered the possibility even without obvious signs. But he didn't, maybe because he assumed she was okay (normal). So this could be an instance of normalcy bias. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: normalcy bias is more about collective denial in crises. This might be more about individual perception and communication. Hmm. Alternatively, the user's failure to anticipate her needs despite prior knowledge could be related to normalcy bias if he dismissed the possibility because ""everything seemed normal."" So yes, maybe. But I need to be careful. The key is whether the user's assumption of normalcy led to not recognizing the problem. Since the girlfriend's behavior didn't show signs, maybe the user isn't exhibiting normalcy bias but rather a lack of awareness. But given that she's had this issue before, maybe he should have considered it even without signs. If he thought ""she's acting normally, so she can't be having low blood sugar again,"" that's normalcy bias. But if there were truly no signs, then it's not his fault. The example's outcome depends on whether there were signs he missed. The user says she was walking around normally. So maybe he didn't see any signs. Therefore, his assumption that she was okay wasn't a bias but a reasonable conclusion based on her behavior. In that case, it's not normalcy bias. But if there were subtle signs he ignored because he expected everything to be normal, then it would be. The user's description says she was quiet and didn't respond when he tried talking. That could be a sign. But he thought she was acting normally. Maybe he dismissed her quietness as normal, hence normalcy bias. Because he assumed her quietness wasn't a sign of a problem. So in that case, he underestimated the possibility of her having low blood sugar because he thought her behavior was normal. So yes, that could be normalcy bias. Because he assumed her quietness wasn't a sign of a problem (maintaining normalcy), leading him to not help. Therefore, the example could be an instance of normalcy bias. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, it's a misunderstanding in communication where the girlfriend expects him to know without cues. But the user's assumption that her behavior was normal despite possible signs (quietness) might align with normalcy bias. So the answer would be yes.
</think>

The example provided can be analyzed through the lens of normalcy bias, which involves underestimating risks or dismissing signs of a problem due to an assumption that conditions will remain normal. In this scenario, the user assumed their girlfriend was fine because she appeared to act normally (e.g., walking around, not overtly signaling distress). However, subtle cues like her quietness and lack of communication could have indicated an issue, especially given her prior history of low blood sugar. The user’s assumption that her behavior was ""normal"" led them to overlook the possibility of her needing help, despite knowing she had experienced this issue before. This aligns with normalcy bias, as the user defaulted to interpreting her actions as typical rather than considering the potential for an adverse event (low blood sugar) requiring intervention. While communication gaps and differing expectations play a role, the core issue involves the user’s cognitive dismissal of a plausible problem due to an ingrained belief in normalcy.

Normalcy Bias,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive"".",0,"The example provided does not directly illustrate the concept of Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias refers to the phenomenon where people believe that because things have always been a certain way, they will always continue to be that way. It often leads to a lack of preparation for potential disasters or changes because individuals assume that their current situation is normal and stable.

In the scenario described, the issue revolves around the perception and treatment of eyewear, particularly the wearing of non-functional glasses by children in an educational setting. The concern is more about the appropriateness and potential dangers of children wearing broken or non-corrective eyewear, as well as the social implications of how glasses are perceived by peers. The response from the administration reflects a lack of understanding or disregard for the concerns raised, but it does not necessarily demonstrate Normalcy Bias.

The situation described seems more related to issues of school policy, child safety, and the social dynamics of peer interactions rather than an assumption that the current state of affairs will remain unchanged in the face of potential threats or changes.

It is a form of cognitive bias that leads individuals to believe that things will always function as they always have in the past.

In the scenario you described, it does not appear to be an instance of Normalcy Bias. The situation you encountered involves an unexpected and uncomfortable social interaction with peers. The discomfort and uncertainty you feel are more aligned with social anxiety or a reaction to an unfamiliar and potentially threatening social situation, rather than an underestimation of a disaster or its effects.

The Normalcy Bias typically involves ignoring or downplaying the signs of an impending disaster, such as a natural disaster or a large-scale emergency, and assuming that things will remain normal despite clear evidence to the contrary. In your case, there is no indication of a disaster or emergency situation, nor is there an underestimation of the likelihood or impact of such an event.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"The example provided does not seem to be an instance of Normalcy Bias. Normalcy Bias is a psychological phenomenon where people assume that things will always function as they usually do, and they underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or crisis. It often leads to a lack of preparation for potential emergencies or dangerous situations.

In the scenario described, the teacher made a judgment call based on their experience and the behavior of the student. The teacher's actions were based on their assessment of the situation, which included the student's age and past behavior. The teacher did not underestimate the likelihood of a crisis; rather, they took steps to address the student's complaint in a way that seemed appropriate given the information available at the time. When the situation escalated, the teacher responded promptly by seeking medical assistance.

The teacher's response to the student's complaint was not driven by an assumption that everything would continue as normal, but rather by a practical approach to dealing with what they perceived as a minor issue. The teacher's subsequent concern and reflection on the incident also indicate a willingness to consider the possibility that their initial judgment might have been incorrect, which is not characteristic of Normalcy Bias.

Normalcy Bias,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks.

Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do.

This phenomenon is often observed in social interactions, where individuals may feel like they are the center of attention, even when others are not as focused on them as they think.

In the given example, the person is expressing frustration and hurt feelings because they feel like others are not paying attention to them when they talk about something they are passionate about, such as movies. They notice when others seem distracted, look away, or zone out, and they interpret this as a sign that the other person does not care about what they have to say.

The Spotlight Effect is relevant here because the person is overestimating the extent to which others are aware of and invested in their conversations. They are taking it personally when others seem distracted or uninterested, and they are assuming that this means the other person does not value their thoughts or opinions.

Moreover, the person is also exhibiting a sense of self-importance, where they believe that their conversations and interests are more significant than they actually are to others. They are expecting others to be as invested and attentive as they are, and they feel hurt and disappointed when this expectation is not met.

The person's perception of being ignored or dismissed is likely exaggerated, and it is possible that others are not as aware of their feelings or as invested in the conversation as they think. The Spotlight Effect can lead people to misinterpret social cues and overestimate the extent to which others are paying attention to them, which can result in feelings of hurt, frustration, and isolation.

In this case, the person's experience and emotions are a classic illustration of the Spotlight Effect. They are overestimating the extent to which others are aware of and invested in their conversations, and they are taking it personally when others seem distracted or uninterested.

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"The concept of the Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others are paying attention to them or their actions. This phenomenon is often observed in social situations where individuals believe they are the center of attention, when in reality, others are more focused on their own thoughts and concerns.

In the given example, the situation involves a couple discussing their upcoming wedding and the groom's concerns about the venue. The bride feels devastated by the groom's suggestion to postpone the wedding due to certain issues with the venue, such as the lack of toilets and the sound system. She believes that these concerns are minor and that the groom is being overly fussy.

The groom's behavior, however, can be seen as an example of the Spotlight Effect. He is intensely focused on the details of the wedding and is worried that the venue's shortcomings will reflect poorly on him and their special day. He wants everything to be perfect for the bride and their guests, and his concerns are driven by a desire to avoid embarrassment or disappointment.

The bride, on the other hand, is more laid-back and doesn't share the same level of concern about the venue's issues. She is focused on the bigger picture – getting married to the groom and having a great day with their loved ones. Her reaction to the groom's concerns is emotional, and she feels that he is being unreasonable.

In this context, the groom's behavior illustrates the Spotlight Effect because he is overestimating the importance of the venue's details and the potential impact they will have on their guests. He is putting himself in the spotlight, imagining that everyone will be paying attention to these minor issues, and is worried about being judged or perceived as having made a poor decision.

The bride's perspective, however, suggests that the groom's concerns are not as significant as he thinks they are. She is more focused on the emotional and personal aspects of the wedding, rather than the logistical details. This disparity in their perspectives highlights the Spotlight Effect, where the groom's intense focus on the details is not shared by the bride or likely by their guests.

Spotlight Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"so , long story short , i was at school , following my classmates to our next classroom. i stopped a bit to talk with another friend from another class , as i was doing so , i noticed my class was getting a bit distant , so i started following them again. and as i did. i got a bit left behind. as i was passing through some 11th graders classroom. i caught one severly staring at me with a really disturbing stare. when i turned around i noticed they were two. i didnt expect for them to be staring at me for long. i tried saying hi (i was standing still without moving) and they kept staring at me with a look in their eyes i cant describe. i at that moment felt extremely uncomfortable as i then i started to walk away. another guy (from the same class as them) was laughing and saying something about me probably , as i got uncomfortable , i decided to leave. i walked for a few steps and i could hear them whispering something about my leather jacket. some of them were 17 or 16. hell i dont even know. that just made me uncomfortable because it happened out of the blue and i never did anything to them or talk to them. i just know that im really uncomfortable about all this and maybe im overreacting",0,"The concept of the Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others notice and pay attention to their appearance, behavior, and actions. This phenomenon is often characterized by individuals feeling like they are ""on stage"" and that others are constantly observing and judging them.

In the given example, the individual experiences a disturbing stare from a group of 11th graders, which makes them feel extremely uncomfortable. They try to diffuse the situation by saying hello, but the staring continues, and they eventually walk away. As they leave, they hear the group whispering about their leather jacket.

The individual's discomfort and perception that the group is staring at them and talking about them could be an instance of the Spotlight Effect. They seem to be overestimating the extent to which the group is focused on them and their appearance (in this case, the leather jacket). The fact that they feel like they are being judged and talked about, despite not having done anything to provoke the group's attention, suggests that they may be experiencing an exaggerated sense of self-awareness and scrutiny.

Furthermore, the individual's reaction to the situation, feeling uncomfortable and wondering if they are overreacting, also hints at the possibility that they are experiencing the Spotlight Effect. They are intensely focused on the group's perceived attention and are interpreting their behavior as being centered around themselves.

It is also possible that the group's behavior was not entirely focused on the individual, and that they were simply passing comments or jokes among themselves. However, from the individual's perspective, it feels like they are the center of attention, which is a classic characteristic of the Spotlight Effect.

Spotlight Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests. But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"The concept of the Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others are paying attention to them, their appearance, or their actions. This phenomenon is often observed in social situations where individuals feel self-conscious or anxious about being the center of attention.

In the given example, the narrator's girlfriend exhibits behaviors that suggest she values her privacy and is secretive about her personal life. She avoids discussing her own interests and feelings, instead focusing on the narrator's life and interests. Additionally, she is extremely possessive about her phone and takes measures to keep its contents private.

The narrator, however, is heavily invested in understanding his girlfriend's thoughts and feelings. He is tortured by the uncertainty surrounding her intentions and feelings towards him, and he often wonders if he is good enough for her. This preoccupation with his girlfriend's perceptions of him and his own self-worth is a key aspect of the situation.

The Spotlight Effect comes into play when the narrator assumes that his girlfriend's secretive behavior is a reflection of her thoughts about him. He believes that her caution and possessiveness are indicative of her feelings towards him, and that she is constantly evaluating him. This assumption leads him to feel anxious and insecure, as he thinks that he is under scrutiny and that his girlfriend is judging him.

However, it is possible that the girlfriend's behavior is not necessarily about the narrator, but rather about her own personal boundaries and privacy concerns. Her secretive nature may be a result of her personality, past experiences, or personal preferences, rather than a reflection of her thoughts about the narrator.

Given this analysis, the narrator's experience can be seen as an instance of the Spotlight Effect, as he is overestimating the extent to which his girlfriend's behavior is focused on him and his self-worth. He is assuming that her actions are a reflection of her thoughts about him, rather than considering alternative explanations for her behavior.

Spotlight Effect,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"The concept of the Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others notice and care about their appearance, behavior, and experiences. In this scenario, the parents of the 18-year-old girl (F18) seem to be exhibiting a classic case of the Spotlight Effect. They assumed that their daughter would want to be the center of attention on her birthday, even if it meant interrupting her cousin's wedding reception.

By silencing the band, getting the microphone, and announcing F18's birthday to the entire gathering, the parents effectively shifted the spotlight from the bride and groom to their daughter. This action was not only awkward for F18 but also for the other guests, many of whom she didn't even know. The fact that F18 had already agreed to celebrate her birthday a week later and had been looking forward to a low-key celebration with her friends suggests that she did not want to be the center of attention on her cousin's special day.

The parents' behavior is a prime example of the Spotlight Effect because they overestimated the importance of their daughter's birthday in the context of the wedding reception. They failed to consider the potential awkwardness and disruption their actions might cause, and instead, focused on their own desire to make their daughter feel special. Their subsequent expectation that F18 would be grateful and praise them for their surprise only adds to the evidence that they were suffering from the Spotlight Effect.

In conclusion, the parents' actions and expectations demonstrate a clear instance of the Spotlight Effect, as they overestimated the extent to which others would care about their daughter's birthday and failed to consider the potential consequences of their actions.

Spotlight Effect,gpt-4o,"I hate it when I’m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like “I wasn’t paying attention”. It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.
I love watching movies. I know it’s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it’s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it. I know that not everyone I met will feel about it the way I do but I still would like to be able to talk about it without feeling like I’m forcing the other person to talk with me. I’m not sure if there’s something I’m doing wrong but I don’t act that way when they talk about something I don’t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don’t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I’m saying as if it doesn’t matter. And like I said it’s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don’t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out. I know that they probably aren’t doing it on purpose and that they probably think I just look at it like it’s a joke but sometimes it actually does hurt my feelings a bit. I wish I didn’t care this much but it’s hard not to.",0,"The spotlight effect is a cognitive bias that leads people to overestimate the extent to which their actions and appearance are noticed by others. Individuals experiencing the spotlight effect assume that others are paying more attention to them than they actually are.

In this example, the person talking feels hurt and neglected when others do not pay attention to them while they enthusiastically share their thoughts and emotions about topics they love, like movies. However, their reaction is more focused on wanting to be understood and reciprocated rather than feeling overly self-conscious about how much attention they receive. They express a desire for their interests and emotions to be valued rather than assuming others are hyper-aware or critical of their enthusiasm.

The spotlight effect typically involves someone worrying excessively about how they are perceived or how much others are noticing their behaviors or mistakes. In this case, the individual feels invalidated because their enthusiasm doesn't seem to be matched, but they do not appear to be overly concerned about how others perceive their level of enthusiasm in itself. Rather, they are disappointed by the lack of reciprocal attention or interest. 

Therefore, the core issue in this example is not an overestimation on the individual's part about how much others notice them but rather a mismatch between their desire for engagement and the response they receive, which does not align with the concept of the spotlight effect.

In the given example, the focus is on a couple discussing their wedding plans, and the bride-to-be's reaction to her fiancé's concerns about their wedding venue. The main issue is her fiancé's dissatisfaction with certain logistical aspects of the venue, which he only noticed after reviewing the venue email. The bride-to-be interprets his concerns as potentially having cold feet, despite his assurances otherwise. The situation appears more about miscommunication and differing expectations rather than an individual believing they are the center of attention or concern in the minds of others. 

The bride-to-be is perhaps focused on her fiancé's actions and perceived intentions, but this is more about the interpretation of his behavior and the emotional weight of their relationship, rather than her worrying excessively about how others perceive her or her actions.

In this scenario, the individual feels intensely scrutinized by the 11th graders, believing they were the sole focus of their stares, laughter, and whispers about their leather jacket. They felt extremely uncomfortable and believed the attention was unwarranted. This aligns with the core of the spotlight effect, where the person assumes their actions and appearance are being noticed and judged more than they likely are. The fact they are ruminating on this incident and feeling ""really uncomfortable"" suggests they believe the encounter was more significant in the minds of the 11th graders than it probably was.

He is focusing intently on her actions and believing that she is also intensely aware of *him* and *his* perceptions of her behavior.

Spotlight Effect,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"The spotlight effect is the phenomenon in which people tend to believe they are being noticed more than they really are. It’s the feeling that everyone is scrutinizing your actions and appearance.

In this scenario, the person (F18) clearly feels that everyone at the wedding was focusing on her during her impromptu birthday celebration. She felt like she ruined her cousin's wedding and that everyone thought she wanted her parents to make a scene. This aligns with the spotlight effect because she overestimated the degree to which others were paying attention to her and judging her actions. She believed she was the center of attention and everyone's thoughts were centered on the ""ruined wedding"" aspect.

It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do.

Their concerns appear to be based on actual feedback and observable behavior from others (people explicitly stating they weren't paying attention, visibly zoning out, or looking away).

1. The writer is receiving direct evidence of others' disinterest

In this situation, we're seeing a communication issue between partners about wedding venue concerns. The fiancé is worried about actual, tangible aspects of the venue (toilets, sound system) and how they might affect the wedding experience for everyone. Meanwhile, the writer is more focused on the emotional and relationship aspects of the situation. Neither person appears to be particularly concerned about being the center of attention or overestimating how much others are noticing them.

If the concern was primarily about guests judging them for having portable toilets or thinking poorly of them for using Spotify, that might be more indicative of the Spotlight Effect. However, the issues described seem to be more about practical concerns and different priorities between the couple.

The fiancé's excessive focus on these details is causing distress and misunderstanding for the bride-to-be, who feels that her partner is being overly fussy and unreasonable.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Spotlight Effect. The Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias in which individuals overestimate the extent to which other people are noticing and focusing on their own perceived flaws or mistakes, while underestimating the extent to which others are focused on their own flaws or mistakes.

In your case, you felt extremely uncomfortable and self-conscious when you were stared at by a group of older students. You assumed that they were judging you negatively, and you felt embarrassed and uncomfortable as a result. This is a classic example of the Spotlight Effect, as you were focusing on your own perceived flaws (in this case, being stared at) and overestimating the extent to which others were noticing and judging you.

It's important to remember that the Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias, and it can lead to inaccurate perceptions and feelings of self-consciousness. It's possible that the older students were not judging you negatively, and they may have been staring at you for a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with you. However, it's understandable that you felt uncomfortable in that situation, and it's important to take steps to manage your feelings of self-consciousness and anxiety.

One way to manage the Spotlight Effect is to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that others are likely focused on their own flaws and mistakes, rather than yours. It can also be helpful to focus on the positive aspects of yourself and to remember that you are more than just the way you are perceived by others.

The scenario you've described appears to be an instance of the Spotlight Effect, although it's not the traditional understanding of the term. The Spotlight Effect typically refers to a psychological phenomenon where a person overestimates the extent to which others are focusing on and noticing their own actions, appearance, or mistakes.

In your case, you're focusing on your girlfriend's behavior and interpreting it as a sign that she may not like you or that you're not good enough for her. This is because you're in the spotlight of your own thoughts and concerns, and you're projecting those feelings onto her actions.

However, it's important to remember that people can have different reasons for their behavior, and it's not always about you. Your girlfriend's privacy and secrecy might be due to various factors, such as personal preferences, past experiences, or cultural norms. It's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns, and to give her the space to share her thoughts as well. This can help reduce the Spotlight Effect and bring you both closer together.",,no,
Spotlight Effect,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

AITA?",0," ANSWER: Yes

This example does appear to be an instance of the Spotlight Effect. The Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias in which a person overestimates the extent to which they are the focus of attention and the extent to which others notice their flaws or mistakes. In this case, the individual believed that their actions during their 18th birthday celebration would be the center of attention and that others would judge them negatively for seemingly taking the focus away from their cousin's wedding. This belief led to feelings of humiliation and a sense that they had ruined both their own birthday and their cousin's wedding. The individual's parents, on the other hand, may have been more focused on their own desire to celebrate the individual's birthday and may have underestimated the negative impact their actions would have on the individual and the overall event.",,yes,

Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do.

The **Spotlight Effect** refers to the cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate how much others notice or care about their appearance, behavior, or actions, as if they are constantly in the ""spotlight."" It often involves the assumption that others are paying more attention to one's mistakes or quirks than they actually are. 

In your example, the primary issue is **feeling undervalued or ignored in conversations**, particularly when discussing topics you’re passionate about (like movies). While there is an element of **assuming others are disengaging more than they might actually be**, the core of your distress stems from **emotional reciprocity** (wanting others to match your level of interest/effort) and **validation**, rather than an overestimation of how much others are judging or noticing you. 

You’re not necessarily assuming that others are hyper-focused on your behavior (as in the Spotlight Effect); instead, you’re frustrated by their **lack of engagement** relative to your expectations. This is more about **unmet social expectations** or **asymmetrical investment in conversations** than the Spotlight Effect.

Thus, while there’s some overlap in the sense that you might be overestimating how much others *should* care, the core phenomenon here is different.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

The **Spotlight Effect** refers to the tendency for individuals to overestimate how much others notice or judge their actions, appearance, or perceived flaws, as if they are in a ""spotlight."" It’s rooted in self-consciousness and the assumption that one’s mistakes or behaviors are more salient to others than they actually are. 

In this scenario, the issue revolves around **miscommunication** and differing **priorities/wedding expectations** between the couple, not an overestimation of how much others (e.g., guests) are scrutinizing the wedding details. The fiancé’s concerns (e.g., portaloos, sound system) reflect his personal standards for the event, not a fear of being judged by others. Similarly, the author’s distress stems from feeling blindsided by their partner’s last-minute objections, not from worrying about others’ perceptions. 

While the fiancé might be overly focused on logistical details, there’s no indication he believes these details will draw disproportionate attention from guests (a key component of the Spotlight Effect). The conflict is interpersonal, not self-conscious.

Here’s why:

The **Spotlight Effect** refers to the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or judge our appearance, behavior, or actions, as if we are constantly in the ""spotlight."" In your case, you felt intensely observed and judged by the 11th graders, particularly their stares and whispers about your leather jacket. This aligns with the Spotlight Effect because you may have assumed their attention was more focused on you than it actually was. It’s possible they were briefly distracted by something (like your jacket) and moved on, but you perceived it as prolonged scrutiny, which amplified your discomfort.

However, the situation also includes objective social discomfort (their stares and laughter were real, not just perceived), which goes beyond the Spotlight Effect. The effect primarily deals with *overestimation* of attention, whereas here, there was genuine attention—just possibly not in the exaggerated way you felt.

Given that the Spotlight Effect involves *overestimating* how much others notice or care about you, and your reaction seems tied to real but possibly misinterpreted attention, this is a partial fit. But if the focus is strictly on whether you overestimated their attention (e.g., assuming their stares were more significant or prolonged than they were), then yes, the Spotlight Effect plays a role.

Okay, so the user is asking if the example given is an instance of the Spotlight Effect. Let me start by recalling what the Spotlight Effect is. From what I remember, the Spotlight Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to overestimate how much others notice their appearance, actions, or behaviors. Essentially, individuals believe they are being observed and judged more than they actually are. It's like when someone spills something on their shirt and thinks everyone is staring, but in reality, most people don't notice or care much.

Now looking at the example provided. The person is talking about feeling hurt when others don't pay attention to their passionate discussions, especially about movies. They feel like others zone out or aren't invested, even though they make an effort to listen when others talk. The key here is their perception that others aren't as attentive as they are, leading to feelings of being ignored or undervalued.

The Spotlight Effect comes into play when someone believes their own actions or interests are the focus of others' attention more than they really are. In this case, the person might be overestimating how much others notice or care about their enthusiasm for movies. They might think that others are actively disinterested or judging their passion, when in reality, the others might not be paying as much attention as the person thinks. The person's emotional response stems from the belief that their interests are under scrutiny and being dismissed, which aligns with the idea of overestimating others' attention (or lack thereof) towards them.

But wait, there's another angle. The person feels others aren't reciprocating the attention they give. The Spotlight Effect is more about the belief that others are noticing you more than they are. Here, the person is upset that others aren't noticing (or engaging with) their interests. So maybe it's a bit different. Alternatively, maybe the person thinks that their interests should be as important to others as they are to themselves, leading them to overestimate how much others should be paying attention. That could tie into the Spotlight Effect because they're assuming their topic is the center of others' focus, but others aren't as focused as they expect.

Alternatively, this could be more about empathy gaps or projection, where the person expects others to care as much as they do. But the core of the Spotlight Effect is the overestimation of being noticed. So if the person thinks that when they talk about movies, others are really paying attention (and thus their lack of engagement is a judgment), that would fit. But the example says the person feels others aren't paying attention, which is the opposite—maybe they think their lack of attention is more noticed than it is. Hmm.

Wait, the Spotlight Effect can also involve overestimating how much others notice one's own internal states. For instance, if you're self-conscious about something, you think others notice it more. In this case, the individual's internal state is their enthusiasm and effort in the conversation. They believe others are more aware of their lack of interest (or more aware of their own effort) than they actually are. The person might think that others are consciously choosing not to engage, but in reality, the others might not even realize the extent of their inattention. The person's hurt feelings come from the belief that their efforts are being ignored (so they overestimate how much others are aware of their own level of engagement).

Alternatively, maybe the person overestimates how much others should notice their interest and adjust their behavior accordingly. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check another angle. The Spotlight Effect is also related to the illusion of transparency, where people think their internal states are more obvious to others than they are. But in this case, the person's internal state is their enthusiasm, and they feel others aren't picking up on it. However, the main issue here is that the person feels others aren't paying attention, not that others are noticing their emotions.

Wait, perhaps the person is overestimating the extent to which their own social blunders or behaviors are noticed. For example, if they think that when they talk about movies, others are noticing how much they're into it and judging them, but in reality, others aren't paying that much attention. But the example isn't about the person feeling judged for their passion, but rather feeling hurt because others aren't listening. So maybe it's not exactly the Spotlight Effect. Unless the person believes that others are more aware of their own inattention than they actually are. For example, if the person thinks that when others look away, it's a deliberate sign of disinterest, but in reality, the others might not realize they're doing it. So the person is overestimating how much their own actions (like talking about movies) are being noticed and evaluated by others. Wait, perhaps the person assumes that others are as focused on their conversation as they are, leading them to take any sign of inattention (like looking away) as a significant slight. But in reality, others might not be as focused, hence the Spotlight Effect—the person overestimates how much others are paying attention to them.

Alternatively, maybe the person is experiencing the opposite. The Spotlight Effect is when you think people notice you more than they do. Here, the person is upset that others aren't noticing (i.e., not paying attention), which might not fit. But perhaps the underlying assumption is that the person's own topic of interest should be as important to others as it is to them, hence overestimating the attention they should receive. For example, they think their movie talk is interesting enough that others would naturally pay attention, but others don't, leading to the feeling that their lack of attention is more intentional or noticeable. That might be more related to the false consensus effect (assuming others share your interests) rather than the Spotlight Effect.

Hmm. So I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the example involves overestimating the extent to which one's own behavior or characteristics are noticed by others. The person feels that others aren't paying attention, which is the opposite of being noticed. But maybe they think that their own actions (talking about movies) are more central to others' attention than they actually are, leading to frustration when others don't engage. For instance, they might believe that when they start talking about movies, others are actively choosing to ignore them, whereas in reality, the others might not even realize the speaker's desire for engagement. That could be a form of overestimating the salience of their own actions in the social context. So in that sense, it's the Spotlight Effect. Because they think their topic is the focus (spotlight), but others aren't really focusing on it as much as they think. The person's assumption that others are as invested as they are might be an overestimation of the attention they're receiving. 

Alternatively, the person might be correctly perceiving that others aren't paying attention but attributing it to personal disregard, which could be more about attribution bias. But the question is whether it's the Spotlight Effect. 

The Spotlight Effect is about overestimating the attention others pay to you. If the person in the example thinks that others are noticing their enthusiasm and are deliberately not engaging (i.e., the person believes their actions are under more scrutiny than they are), then it's the Spotlight Effect. But if the person is accurately perceiving that others aren't paying attention and is upset about it, then it's not. However, the person's feelings of hurt stem from the belief that others are not paying attention despite their own efforts. The key is whether they overestimate how much others notice their own behavior. 

Wait, another angle: the person might think that their own social missteps (like talking about something others aren't interested in) are more noticeable than they are. For example, they might think that others are noticing their enthusiasm and judging them for it, but in reality, others aren't paying that much attention. But in the example, the person isn't worried about being judged; they're upset that others aren't listening. So perhaps it's not exactly the Spotlight Effect. 

Alternatively, the person's assumption that others should be paying attention because they themselves are so invested could be a form of egocentric bias, which is related to the Spotlight Effect. They can't imagine that others aren't as focused on their topic as they are. So when others don't pay attention, it's a surprise and a hurtful experience. This would align with the Spotlight Effect because the person overestimates the extent to which their own interests are the focus of others' attention. 

In conclusion, the example does seem to involve the Spotlight Effect. The individual believes that their passion and the topics they care about are more central to others' attention than they actually are. They overestimate how much others should be interested and attentive, leading to the feeling of being ignored when others don't meet those expectations. Hence, this is an instance of the Spotlight Effect.

The example provided illustrates the **Spotlight Effect**, a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate how much others notice or care about their actions, appearance, or interests. In this case, the person feels hurt when others do not engage with their passionate discussions about movies, interpreting this lack of attention as intentional disregard or indifference. However, the emotional response stems from an overestimation of how much their enthusiasm and conversational efforts are being noticed or prioritized by others. 

The Spotlight Effect manifests here in two ways:  
1. **Overestimation of Salience**: The person assumes their topic of interest (movies) holds the same level of importance to others as it does to them. They believe their enthusiasm should naturally command attention, not recognizing that others may not share their level of interest or focus.

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of the Spotlight Effect. First, I need to recall what the Spotlight Effect actually is. From what I remember, the Spotlight Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to overestimate how much others notice and pay attention to their appearance or actions. Like, if you spill something on your shirt, you might think everyone notices, but in reality, most people don't. It's about the belief that one is being observed more than they actually are.

Now, looking at the example given. The situation involves a couple planning their wedding. The fiancé is concerned about details like portaloos and the sound system, wanting to possibly postpone the wedding to find a better venue. The person writing the post is upset because they feel everything is set and they just want to get married, not caring much about those details. The fiancé is worried the wedding might be subpar, but the writer thinks he's overreacting.

The question is whether this is an instance of the Spotlight Effect. Let me break it down. The Spotlight Effect involves someone believing others are paying more attention to them than they really are. In this case, the fiancé is worried about the quality of the wedding (like portaloos and sound system), perhaps thinking that guests will notice and judge these aspects more harshly than they actually will. He might be overestimating how much the guests care about these details. The writer, on the other hand, doesn't care and thinks the guests won't mind either. 

So if the fiancé's concern stems from the belief that the guests will focus a lot on the portaloos or the Spotify playlist, then that would be the Spotlight Effect. He's assuming others (the guests) are paying more attention to these aspects than they actually would. However, the example doesn't explicitly state that the fiancé is worried about others' perceptions. His reasoning is more about wanting the best possible day and that the current setup might be subpar. He might be concerned about their own standards rather than what others think. 

Wait, the fiancé says he wants them and their kids to have the best possible day and that the issues are red flags leading to a subpar wedding. So his focus is on their own experience and possibly the quality, not necessarily the guests' opinions. Unless his idea of a subpar wedding is influenced by what others might think. But the example doesn't mention that. The writer's perspective is that they don't care about those details and just want to get married. 

The Spotlight Effect is about overestimating others' attention. If the fiancé is worried that the guests will judge the wedding harshly because of the portaloos or sound system, then yes. But if he's concerned about his own standards for the wedding's quality, not others' perceptions, then it's not the Spotlight Effect. The example doesn't clearly state that the fiancé is worried about others' judgments. He might just have higher standards for the event itself. 

Therefore, this might not be an instance of the Spotlight Effect. Unless there's an implied assumption that others will notice these things, but the text doesn't make that explicit. The fiancé's worry seems more about the quality of the event from their own perspective rather than others' perceptions. So the answer would probably be no.
</think>

The Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or care about our actions, appearance, or decisions, as if we are under a metaphorical ""spotlight."" In the example provided, the fiancé expresses concerns about practical aspects of the wedding (e.g., portaloos, Spotify sound system) because he wants the day to meet high standards for themselves and their children. However, there is no clear indication that his worries stem from an exaggerated belief that *others* (e.g., guests) will scrutinize or judge these details harshly. Instead, his focus appears to be on his own expectations for quality and his desire to avoid a ""sub par"" experience for the couple and their family. 

The writer, meanwhile, dismisses these concerns as unimportant, prioritizing the emotional significance of the wedding over logistical details. While the fiancé’s anxiety could involve some projection of his own standards onto others, the example does not explicitly tie his reservations to a fear of external judgment. His concerns seem internally motivated (e.g., wanting the ""best possible day"" for loved ones) rather than rooted in an overestimation of others’ attention to flaws. Thus, this scenario does not clearly align with the Spotlight Effect, which specifically involves misjudging how much others notice or care about one’s perceived shortcomings.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example they provided is an instance of the Spotlight Effect. First, I need to recall what the Spotlight Effect actually is. From what I remember, the Spotlight Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to overestimate how much others notice and pay attention to their appearance or behavior. Basically, someone might think everyone is looking at them or judging them when in reality, others aren't really paying that much attention.

Now, looking at the example given. The person was at school, stopped to talk to a friend, then noticed their class moving away. When catching up, they passed some 11th graders who were staring. The individual felt uncomfortable, tried to say hi, but the others kept staring. Then another person laughed, and they heard whispers about their leather jacket. The person felt really uncomfortable and thinks they might be overreacting.

So, the key points here are the perception that others (the 11th graders) were staring and talking about them, specifically the jacket. The individual feels self-conscious and assumes that the group was focused on them. However, according to the Spotlight Effect, the reality might be that those students weren't as focused on them as they thought. Maybe the staring wasn't as intense or prolonged as perceived, or perhaps the whispers were about something else. The person's anxiety made them believe they were the center of attention when, in fact, others might not have been paying that much attention.

Wait, but in this case, there were actual signs like the stare, the laughter, and the mention of the jacket. The Spotlight Effect is more about overestimating others' attention. If the other students really were staring and commenting, then maybe it's not the Spotlight Effect. But perhaps the person is overestimating the extent or the duration. For example, maybe the staring was brief, but the person felt it was longer. Or the whispers were not actually about them, but they assumed it was. The person mentions they might be overreacting, which suggests they are questioning their own perception. 

Alternatively, if the classmates were genuinely paying attention and making comments, then the person's reaction isn't an overestimation. But the Spotlight Effect is about the belief that others are paying more attention than they actually are. So if in reality the group wasn't really focused on them, but the person thought they were, then it's the Spotlight Effect. But if the group was actually focusing on them, then it's not. 

The example has the person hearing whispers about their jacket. If that's accurate, then others did notice. But the effect could still apply if the person is overestimating how much others care or how negative the attention is. For instance, maybe the group briefly noticed the jacket and made a comment, but the individual feels it's a bigger deal than it is. The person's discomfort and feeling of being stared at might be amplified by their own self-consciousness, leading them to think it's more severe than it actually was. 

The key here is whether the perception of being the center of attention is exaggerated. The fact that the person is questioning if they're overreacting aligns with the Spotlight Effect, where the individual's anxiety leads them to overestimate others' focus. Even if there was some attention, the person's reaction (feeling extremely uncomfortable, thinking they're overreacting) suggests they might be magnifying the situation beyond what's real. 

So, putting it all together, this scenario does involve the person feeling like they're under more scrutiny than they actually are. The presence of some actual attention (like the jacket comment) doesn't negate the possibility of the Spotlight Effect if the individual's perception of the extent or intensity is exaggerated. Since the person is unsure and considers they might be overreacting, this aligns with the Spotlight Effect's characteristics. Therefore, the example is an instance of the Spotlight Effect.
</think>

The Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or judge one's appearance, behavior, or actions, assuming oneself to be the focus of attention more than is actually the case. In the example provided, the individual perceives being intensely scrutinized by a group of older students—noting stares, laughter, and whispers about their leather jacket—leading to significant discomfort and self-doubt about whether they are overreacting. 

While there are observable cues (e.g., stares, whispers), the Spotlight Effect could still apply here because the individual’s distress stems from an assumption that they are the central focus of the group’s attention. The discomfort and self-consciousness—coupled with the uncertainty expressed (""maybe I’m overreacting"")—suggest an amplification of perceived scrutiny. Even if some attention was real (e.g., a brief comment about the jacket), the emotional weight and prolonged unease likely exceed the actual level of interest from the observers. The psychological dynamic aligns with the Spotlight Effect, as the individual’s anxiety magnifies their belief in being the target of sustained or judgmental attention, even if the reality was more fleeting or less consequential.

Spotlight Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests. But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the Spotlight Effect. First, I need to recall what the Spotlight Effect actually is. From what I remember, the Spotlight Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to overestimate how much others notice and pay attention to their appearance or behavior. Like, if you do something embarrassing, you might think everyone noticed, but in reality, people don't pay as much attention as you think.

Now, looking at the example: the user's girlfriend is very private, doesn't post on social media, avoids talking about herself, redirects conversations to him, and is super possessive of her phone. The user feels anxious, wondering if she likes him, if he's not good enough, etc. The key here is whether the girlfriend's behavior is due to her thinking that others (especially the user) are paying more attention to her than they actually are. But wait, the girlfriend's actions seem more about her own privacy and possibly hiding something (like being secretive with her phone). The user's anxiety is about not knowing her well and feeling insecure.

The Spotlight Effect usually involves someone overestimating how much others are noticing their own actions. For example, if the girlfriend was avoiding talking about herself because she thought the user was hyper-focused on her every move, that might be the Spotlight Effect. But in this case, her behavior isn't necessarily because she thinks others are paying excessive attention to her. Instead, she's being secretive, which makes the user anxious. The user's anxiety might be more related to his own insecurities rather than the Spotlight Effect. The girlfriend's actions are about her own privacy and perhaps trust issues, not her overestimating others' attention on her. So I don't think this is an example of the Spotlight Effect. The effect here is more about the user's personal worries and the girlfriend's secretiveness, not an overestimation of being observed.
</think>

The example provided does not align with the **Spotlight Effect**. The Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or care about one's own actions, appearance, or behaviors. For instance, someone might avoid wearing a bold outfit because they assume everyone will scrutinize it, when in reality, most people pay little attention. 

In this scenario, the girlfriend’s behavior—being private, redirecting conversations, and guarding her phone—is driven by her personal preference for privacy or possible secrecy, not by an assumption that others are hyper-focused on her. The user’s anxiety stems from interpreting her guardedness as a reflection of his own inadequacy or her potential lack of interest, which relates more to insecurity, trust issues, or communication gaps rather than the Spotlight Effect. The girlfriend’s actions are not rooted in a belief that others are closely monitoring her; instead, they reflect her own boundaries or undisclosed reasons. The user’s distress arises from uncertainty about the relationship dynamics, not from overestimating how much attention others (like the girlfriend) are directing toward him.

Spotlight Effect,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the example given is an instance of the Spotlight Effect. First, I need to remember what the Spotlight Effect actually is. From what I recall, the Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate how much others notice and pay attention to their appearance or actions. Basically, you think everyone is noticing you way more than they actually are. Like if you wear a weird shirt, you might think everyone is staring, but in reality, most people don't even notice.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person's 18th birthday coincides with their cousin's wedding. They had agreed to celebrate a week later, but the parents surprised them by announcing the birthday at the wedding reception. The person felt humiliated and thought they ruined the cousin's wedding. The parents thought it was a great surprise and are upset the person didn't appreciate it.

So, the key here is whether the person is overestimating how much others (the guests) noticed or cared about the birthday interruption. The person felt like they were the center of unwanted attention and that everyone noticed and judged them, possibly thinking they were trying to steal the spotlight. But according to the Spotlight Effect, maybe the guests didn't pay as much attention as the person thought. However, in this case, the parents actually made a big deal out of it by stopping the band, making an announcement, giving gifts, etc. So the attention was real and significant. The guests probably did notice because the parents forced the attention onto the birthday person during the wedding. 

Wait, but the Spotlight Effect is about the individual's perception that others are paying more attention than they actually are. If the parents really did create a scene, then the attention was real. The person's feeling of humiliation might be accurate, not an overestimation. But maybe the person is overestimating how much the guests cared or judged them. Like, maybe the guests didn't think it was a big deal, even though there was a scene. The person felt it was humiliating and that they ruined the wedding, but perhaps others just moved on quickly and didn't think much of it. If that's the case, then the person's belief that they ""destroyed the wedding"" might be an example of the Spotlight Effect, because they're overestimating the negative attention they received.

Alternatively, if the guests were genuinely annoyed or thought it was inappropriate, then the person's assessment is accurate, and the Spotlight Effect doesn't apply. The effect is about misjudging others' attention. So the crux is whether the person's belief that they ruined the wedding and were humiliated is an overestimation (Spotlight Effect) or a correct assessment based on actual reactions.

In the story, the person says it was ""horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests,"" and they spent the rest of the time hiding. The guests' reaction isn't detailed beyond that. The person assumes that others (like the cousin) would think they wanted the attention, but maybe the cousin and guests didn't really care that much. The parents called off the next celebration, thinking the wedding moment was sufficient, but the person feels it wasn't. The key is whether the person's embarrassment is due to an overestimation of others' attention (Spotlight Effect) or a genuine significant disruption.

Hmm. The Spotlight Effect would be the person thinking that everyone noticed and judged them more than they actually did. If the parents made a big scene, then the guests did notice. But the person's belief that they ""destroyed the wedding"" might be an overestimation. For example, maybe the cousin and guests were momentarily distracted but didn't hold it against the person. The person's own feelings of humiliation and guilt could be stronger than what others actually thought. So even though there was a real interruption, the lasting impact on others' perceptions might be less than the person fears, which would align with the Spotlight Effect.

Alternatively, if the cousin was upset and the guests were genuinely annoyed, then the person's assessment is correct, and the Spotlight Effect isn't at play. The example doesn't give direct evidence of the cousin's reaction, only the person's own feelings and the parents' reaction. The person's statement that they felt like they ruined the wedding might be their own perception, not reality. If the cousin wasn't actually upset, then the person is overestimating the negative attention (Spotlight Effect). But if the cousin was upset, then it's not the effect.

Since the example doesn't mention the cousin's reaction, we have to infer. The person says they are very close to the cousin and felt like they ruined the wedding, but there's no info on the cousin's actual feelings. The parents thought it was a good idea. The guests were half strangers and it was awkward, but maybe they didn't dwell on it. So the person's anxiety about others' judgments might be exaggerated compared to reality. Therefore, this could be an example of the Spotlight Effect because the individual believes others are focusing on them more than they actually are. Even though there was a real scene, the person's perception of the extent of negative judgment might be inflated.
</think>

The example provided does **not** clearly illustrate the Spotlight Effect. The Spotlight Effect refers to the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or judge one's actions or appearance, believing oneself to be the focus of more attention than is actually the case. In this scenario, the humiliation and awkwardness described stem from a **real and intentional disruption** caused by the parents during the wedding reception. The parents actively redirected attention to the birthday announcement by silencing the band, making a public speech, and presenting gifts—actions that objectively drew significant attention to the individual. 

The person’s feelings of humiliation and guilt likely reflect a reasonable assessment of the situation, given the explicit interruption of the wedding event. While the person may fear that guests judged them harshly or that the cousin resented the disruption, the narrative does not provide evidence that these perceptions are exaggerated (as required for the Spotlight Effect). Instead, the discomfort appears rooted in a genuine social misstep orchestrated by the parents, not an overestimation of others’ attention. The parents’ actions created a tangible spotlight, making the attention unavoidable rather than imagined. 

Furthermore, the person’s concern about overshadowing the cousin’s wedding aligns with social norms against hijacking others’ events, suggesting a realistic understanding of the situation rather than a cognitive bias. While the guests’ actual reactions (beyond momentary awkwardness) are not detailed, the disruption itself was real and significant, meaning the person’s distress is not based on an overestimation of attention but on the actual consequences of their parents’ actions.

I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do.

Spotlight Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"so , long story short , i was at school , following my classmates to our next classroom. i stopped a bit to talk with another friend from another class , as i was doing so , i noticed my class was getting a bit distant , so i started following them again. and as i did. i got a bit left behind. as i was passing through some 11th graders classroom. i caught one severly staring at me with a really disturbing stare. when i turned around i noticed they were two. i didnt expect for them to be staring at me for long. i tried saying hi (i was standing still without moving) and they kept staring at me with a look in their eyes i cant describe. i at that moment felt extremely uncomfortable as i then i started to walk away. another guy (from the same class as them) was laughing and saying something about me probably , as i got uncomfortable , i decided to leave. i walked for a few steps and i could hear them whispering something about my leather jacket. some of them were 17 or 16. hell i dont even know. that just made me uncomfortable because it happened out of the blue and i never did anything to them or talk to them. i just know that im really uncomfortable about all this and maybe im overreacting",0,"The Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the extent to which they are being observed or judged by others. In the scenario you described, you felt uncomfortable and believed that the 11th graders were staring at you and possibly making comments about your leather jacket. This feeling of being the center of attention and the belief that others are focusing on you more than they actually are, fits the description of the Spotlight Effect.

The discomfort you felt and the belief that the other students were whispering about you, even though you may not have been the main focus of their attention, are indicative of this bias. The Spotlight Effect can cause individuals to feel self-conscious and to overestimate the attention others are paying to them, which seems to be the case in your situation.

Spotlight Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests. But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"The Spotlight Effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals overestimate the amount of attention others are paying to them. This effect can lead people to believe that they are more noticeable or stand out more than they actually do, often causing them to feel self-conscious or embarrassed in social situations.

In the scenario you've described, it appears that your girlfriend's behavior is causing you distress and making you question the nature of your relationship. However, her behavior does not seem to be a direct manifestation of the Spotlight Effect. Instead, it seems to be more about her personal boundaries, privacy, and perhaps her discomfort with sharing certain aspects of her life with you.

The Spotlight Effect would involve your girlfriend overestimating how much attention others are paying to her or your relationship, leading her to feel self-conscious or embarrassed. However, the behavior you describe seems more related to her own privacy concerns and the dynamics of your relationship rather than a belief that others are overly focused on her.

Therefore, the example provided is not an instance of the Spotlight Effect.

Spotlight Effect,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"The Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the extent to which others notice their appearance or behavior. In the example provided, the individual feels embarrassed and believes that the guests at the wedding, as well as the family, are focusing on their 18th birthday celebration during the wedding reception. This belief that others are paying more attention to their birthday than they actually are, and the resulting embarrassment, is an instance of the Spotlight Effect.

Illusory Superiority,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority refers to the tendency for people to overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or performance relative to others. In the context of the provided example, it appears that the mother is exhibiting behavior that could be related to Illusory Superiority, but it is more directly related to her expectations and sense of entitlement.

The mother's reaction to not receiving a personalized Facebook post from her daughter is disproportionate to the efforts the daughter made to celebrate Mother's Day. The daughter went to great lengths to show her appreciation, including spending the day with her mother, attending church and brunch, taking her shopping, and giving her gifts. However, the mother's focus on the lack of a Facebook post suggests that she has an inflated sense of what she deserves and is entitled to.

The mother's behavior can also be seen as an example of emotional manipulation, as she uses guilt and self-pity to try to control her daughter's actions. By playing the victim and claiming that her daughter is being disrespectful, the mother is attempting to shift the focus away from her own unreasonable expectations and onto her daughter's perceived shortcomings.

The daughter's perception of her mother's behavior as ungrateful and manipulative is understandable, given the context of their past interactions. The mother's tendency to make rude comments and then deny or downplay them when confronted is a classic example of gaslighting behavior, which can be damaging to relationships and individual self-esteem.

In terms of Illusory Superiority, the mother's behavior could be seen as a manifestation of this concept, as she appears to overestimate her own importance and the level of attention and adoration she deserves from her daughter. However, it is more accurate to describe her behavior as an example of entitlement and emotional manipulation, rather than simply Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I know they’re undercover agents working for an secret organization for god knows how long now. My voices in my head told me everything, I connected all the dots. & everything makes perfect sense. They’ve been gathering Intel on me then sending it to their secret organization that works for a national organization (FBI,CIA,NSA)

I know undercover agents are watching me & following me when I leave the house & they have hidden cameras around my apartment building to watch when I leave my apartment. The voices are telling me all the details as I speak, so I know it’s true. The voices told me everything I needed to know, I know they’re in cahoots with some organization under cover. I know ppl are watching me via undercover agents/ hidden cameras & they are all undercover.

They’re trying to gradually extract info from me cuz I know where the aliens are, that info I ain’t disclosing to them whatever secret organization they’re with I know they’ve already have a ton of Intel on me as it is. My voices told me where aliens are but I ain’t gonna disclose that info cuz I know ppl are watching my every move via hidden cameras & undercover agents. Plus they’re all undercover agents.

My voices also said that some aliens are walking among us disguised as normal ppl. Another reason why is when I called them out about the fact that they’re all undercover agents & what their true motives about acquiring where the aliens were they removed me from the group chat they knew they were caught so they removed me completely to maintain their cover.

I know they’re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn’t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of. I was freaking out for real, I was like I ain’t say shit to them. I know that there are aliens in disguise walking among us my voices told me.",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own abilities, intelligence, or knowledge relative to others. This can lead people to believe they have a unique understanding or insight that others lack. In the given example, the individual exhibits several characteristics that may be related to Illusory Superiority, but it is more prominently an instance of paranoid delusion and grandiosity.

The individual claims to possess exclusive knowledge about aliens and their whereabouts, which they believe makes them a target for undercover agents working for secret organizations. They also believe that their ""voices"" provide them with accurate information about these agents and their motives. This perceived superiority in knowledge and understanding is a key aspect of Illusory Superiority.

However, the primary issue here appears to be a detachment from reality, characterized by paranoid delusions and a lack of evidence-based reasoning. The individual's beliefs are not grounded in empirical evidence but rather in the voices they hear, which they take as absolute truth. This is more indicative of a psychiatric condition, such as schizophrenia, than a simple cognitive bias like Illusory Superiority.

Despite this, the element of believing oneself to be uniquely informed or insightful, especially in comparison to others (in this case, the perceived undercover agents and their organizations), does align with the concept of Illusory Superiority. The individual's conviction in their superior knowledge and their ability to ""connect the dots"" that others cannot, further supports this interpretation.

Given the complexities of the example, which includes both a grandiose belief in one's knowledge and a severe detachment from reality, it's challenging to categorize it purely as an instance of Illusory Superiority. However, the presence of a belief in one's superior insight or knowledge, despite being delusional, does share some characteristics with Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority refers to the tendency for people to overestimate their own abilities, intelligence, or performance relative to others. In this case, the husband's sister appears to be exhibiting Illusory Superiority in her artistic abilities. Despite her paintings being described as ""terrible"" and comparable to something an 8-year-old could create, she continues to produce and gift them to others, seemingly unaware of their lack of quality or appeal.

Her behavior suggests that she overestimates the value and appreciation others will have for her handmade gifts, particularly her paintings. She may genuinely believe that her artwork is good or even exceptional, and that others will appreciate the thought and effort she puts into creating them. This is evident in her decision to make something for the couple despite them providing a clear indication of their preferences (i.e., items on their Amazon wishlist).

Furthermore, her actions are not solely driven by a desire to be frugal or thoughtful, as she and her husband are described as spending ""ridiculous amounts of money"" on dining out and other luxuries. This inconsistency suggests that she may be motivated by a desire to showcase her artistic talents, rather than simply being considerate of others' budgets.

The fact that the couple has never expressed their true feelings about the gifts, opting instead to politely accept and store them away, may have contributed to the sister's Illusory Superiority. Without any negative feedback or criticism, she may have continued to believe that her artwork is well-received and appreciated.

In conclusion, the husband's sister's behavior is a classic example of Illusory Superiority, as she overestimates the quality and appeal of her artistic abilities, and consequently, the value of her handmade gifts.

Illusory Superiority,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority refers to the cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own abilities, intelligence, or performance relative to others. This phenomenon is often observed when people believe they are above average in various aspects, such as intelligence, driving skills, or other abilities. In the given example, the friend (M41) claims to be smarter than 95% of the population, which is a clear indication of Illusory Superiority.

The friend's statement is not backed by any objective evidence or credible sources, and it seems to be based on his own subjective perception. He also exhibits other behaviors that are consistent with Illusory Superiority, such as looking down on others (""ragging on how dumb the average person is"") and making snobby comments about people's intelligence. Additionally, his defensive response to being questioned about his claim, as well as his tendency to belittle others' opinions (""You just don't understand what I'm trying to do""), suggests that he is invested in maintaining a superior self-image.

It's also worth noting that the narrator's assessment of the friend's intelligence (""He's not a dummy but he's far from a genius"") and the fact that their mutual friends would agree with this assessment, suggests that the friend's self-perceived intelligence is not entirely aligned with his actual abilities. This discrepancy between self-perception and reality is a hallmark of Illusory Superiority.

Therefore, based on the friend's claim of being smarter than 95% of the population, his behavior, and the narrator's observations, it appears that this is indeed an instance of Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority refers to the tendency for people to overestimate their own abilities, intelligence, or performance relative to others.

In the given scenario, the narrator (25m) and his cousin (28f) engage in a conversation about intelligence, with the cousin seeking validation for her PhD and the narrator refusing to concede that she is more intelligent. The narrator's perception of his cousin's intelligence is based on his own subjective criteria, which include being ""quick-witted, adaptable, open-minded, and exploratory."" He believes that these traits are essential for true intelligence and that his cousin lacks them, despite her academic achievements.

The narrator's assessment of his cousin's intelligence can be seen as an instance of Illusory Superiority. He is essentially creating a narrative that justifies his own perceived superiority, despite his cousin's objective achievements (i.e., a PhD in computer science). By downplaying the significance of his cousin's academic accomplishments and emphasizing his own perceived strengths (e.g., being a successful filmmaker), the narrator is able to maintain a self-image of being more intelligent or capable.

Furthermore, the narrator's response to his cousin's needling and demands for validation suggests that he is invested in maintaining this self-image. When his cousin becomes angry and defensive, the narrator seizes the opportunity to point out her supposed lack of confidence, which he believes undermines her claim to being more intelligent. This exchange reveals that the narrator is not only convinced of his own superiority but also motivated to defend it against perceived threats.

In conclusion, the narrator's behavior and perceptions in this scenario exhibit characteristics of Illusory Superiority. He overestimates his own abilities and intelligence relative to his cousin, despite her objective achievements, and engages in a defensive and self-justifying narrative to maintain his self-image.

Illusory Superiority,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority refers to the tendency for people to overestimate their own abilities, intelligence, or performance relative to others. This phenomenon is often observed in social comparisons, where individuals tend to believe they are better than average in various aspects of life.

In the given example, the author of the post describes a situation where they and their fiancé are boarding a plane, and the fiancé's large carry-on bag is not allowed on the flight. The author, having anticipated this issue and packed a smaller bag, is able to board the plane without problems. When the airline worker and a cop arrive to remove the fiancé from the plane, the author is asked if they are together, and they respond by saying ""NO!"" and shaking their head emphatically.

The author's actions in this situation can be seen as a manifestation of Illusory Superiority in the sense that they are prioritizing their own interests and needs (i.e., getting to their destination and meeting their work commitments) over their fiancé's well-being and feelings. By denying their relationship with their fiancé, the author is able to avoid getting involved in the conflict and potentially being removed from the plane as well.

Moreover, the author's justification for their actions, which includes mentioning that their boss and coworkers were relying on them to be back on time for a important project, can be seen as a way of rationalizing their behavior and reinforcing their own sense of importance and superiority. The fact that the author's social circle, except for their boss and coworkers, thinks they are an asshole for their actions suggests that their behavior may not be as justified or reasonable as they believe it to be.

Overall, the author's actions and attitude in this situation can be seen as an instance of Illusory Superiority, as they are prioritizing their own interests and needs over others, and rationalizing their behavior in a way that reinforces their own sense of importance and superiority.

In the text, the individual is expressing paranoid thoughts and delusions, possibly related to a mental health condition such as schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. The focus of the text is on the person's belief that they are being surveilled by undercover agents and have special knowledge about aliens that others do not.

Illusory Superiority,gpt-4o,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The concept of ""Illusory Superiority"" refers to a cognitive bias wherein individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities compared to others. People with this bias might think they are better than average in various domains, such as intelligence, driving skills, or social competence, without sufficient evidence to justify that belief.

In the scenario you've provided, the issue at hand involves a disparity in perceived value between handmade gifts and purchased gifts. The person feels that the handmade paintings by their sister-in-law do not hold the same value as the gifts they provide her, which are typically bought from a list of desired items. The complaint seems centered around the perceived inequality in gift-giving rather than a belief that the gift-givers are superior in skill or ability.

While there is evident frustration with the quality of the sister-in-law's gifts, the scenario focuses more on the perceived imbalance and fairness of gift exchanges rather than an assertion of one’s own superiority in creating gifts or making other personal judgments. It does not describe a situation where the gift-giver overestimates their own gift-giving abilities compared to others in a way that aligns with the definition of illusory superiority.

Illusory Superiority,gpt-4o,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias whereby individuals overestimate their own qualities, abilities, or intelligence relative to others.

Illusory Superiority,gpt-4o,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"The scenario you described appears to illustrate an instance of illusory superiority, which is a cognitive bias where a person overestimates their own abilities or qualities compared to others. In the context of the situation, you (the narrator) seem to exhibit this bias by believing that you possess more generalized intelligence than your cousin, despite her achieving a PhD in computer science. You assess her intelligence as limited to being ""in her niche,"" and you conclude she lacks traits you associate with being ""truly intelligent."" This perception seems to influence your assertion that she is not exceptionally intelligent as you consider your own qualities (quick-wittedness, adaptability, open-mindedness) to be indicators of greater intelligence, even in the absence of a higher academic degree.

Moreover, your belief in your superior intelligence leads to a conflict during your family visit, as you interpret her needling as an inferiority complex rather than considering that she might be seeking recognition for her academic achievements. While this situation is complex and both individuals exhibit elements of defensiveness and entitlement regarding their own intellectual standing, your conviction in your superior intelligence fits the pattern of illusory superiority in relation to her accomplishments.

Illusory Superiority,gpt-4o,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"The concept of illusory superiority, also known as the ""better-than-average effect,"" describes a cognitive bias whereby individuals overestimate their own qualities, abilities, and characteristics relative to others. This bias typically manifests in people believing that they are better than the average person in various domains, such as intelligence, driving skills, or social judgment.

In the example provided, the narrator describes a situation where they made a decision based on self-preservation during a conflict involving their fiancé and an airline worker. The narrator does not explicitly claim to have superior qualities or abilities in relation to others, nor do they suggest that they are better than average in any particular domain.

Instead, the narrative focuses on the narrator's actions and their justifications for those actions during a stressful event. While the narrator describes their ability to pack efficiently and navigate airline policies effectively, which may imply competence in travel-related matters, there is no explicit comparison suggesting they perceive themselves as superior to others in this context.

Therefore, the example does not illustrate the concept of illusory superiority, as the focus is not on the narrator's perceived superiority over others, but rather on a specific incident involving decision-making under pressure.

Illusory Superiority,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Potential for Illusory Superiority:** The author believes their gift-giving habits are superior to the sister-in-law's. They consistently spend money and fulfill the requested items on wishlists, whereas the sister-in-law offers ""terrible"" handmade gifts despite knowing the recipient's preferences. There is an implication that they are more considerate and generous gifters.
*   **Missing Clear Indicators:** Illusory superiority often manifests as a generalized belief in being ""better than average"" in various domains. While the author implies superior gift-giving skills, the text focuses primarily on the *specific* exchange dynamics and the frustrations arising from this perceived imbalance.
*   **Primary Focus on Frustration:** The main emotion conveyed is frustration, not necessarily a generalized sense of superiority. The author is annoyed by the perceived mismatch in effort, consideration, and financial investment in gift exchanges, and feels their needs and preferences aren't valued. This frustration stems from a specific situation, rather than from a broader sense of being superior.
*   **Acknowledging Potential Bias:** While the author believes the gifts are terrible, they also understand that they haven't said anything because it ""seems mean"". This suggests some level of self-awareness and acknowledgement that their perception might be subjective or that their opinion could cause hurt feelings.
*   **Situational Context:** The author's annoyance is tied to a specific scenario (gift-giving) within a particular relationship. While some element of ""we are better at this thing"" exists, it's less about a generalized feeling of superiority and more about a very defined problem area.

The mother isn't displaying an overestimation of her own abilities or qualities compared to others. Instead, she's exhibiting demanding behavior and emotional manipulation by:
- Dismissing genuine acts of appreciation
- Focusing solely on social media validation
- Using emotional manipulation tactics (tears, playing victim)
- Enlisting others to pressure her daughter
- Using guilt as a weapon

This is more indicative of narcissistic or manipulative behavior patterns rather than Illusory Superiority.

Instead, this appears to be an example of paranoid delusions and possibly symptoms of schizophrenia or another mental health condition characterized by:

1. Auditory hallucinations (""voices in my head"")
2. Paranoid beliefs about being watched and followed
3. Conspiracy theories involving government agencies
4. Delusional beliefs about aliens and undercover agents
5. Connecting unrelated events into a coherent but false narrative

Illusory Superiority (also known as the above-average effect) is a cognitive bias where people overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. It involves people believing they are better than average at various tasks or have superior traits compared to their peers.

The text provided shows no clear indication that the person believes they are superior to others. Instead, they are expressing paranoid thoughts and responding to auditory hallucinations that are telling them about supposed conspiracies involving government agents and aliens.

Illusory Superiority,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"This doesn't appear to be an example of Illusory Superiority. Illusory Superiority (also known as the above-average effect) is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. In this situation, the sister-in-law isn't necessarily demonstrating that she believes her artistic abilities are superior to others - she's simply continuing a gift-giving practice that she's established over the years.

The issue described here is more about mismatched gift-giving expectations and potentially poor self-awareness regarding the quality and appropriateness of her gifts, rather than an explicit belief that her artistic abilities are superior to others. If she were constantly talking about how she's a better artist than most people or comparing herself favorably to established artists, that would be more indicative of Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"This is a clear example of Illusory Superiority, also known as the ""above-average effect"" or ""superiority bias."" This cognitive bias occurs when individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities in relation to others.

Several aspects of this story demonstrate Illusory Superiority:

1. The friend believes he's smarter than 95% of the population without any objective evidence to support this claim
2. He regularly disparages the intelligence of others while elevating his own
3. When faced with disagreement, he dismisses others' perspectives by suggesting they ""don't understand,"" rather than considering their viewpoints
4. The narrator notes that while the friend isn't unintelligent, he's ""far from a genius,"" suggesting a significant disparity between the friend's self-perception and reality
5. The friend's reaction to being questioned about his claim suggests he hasn't critically examined this belief

This is particularly characteristic of Illusory Superiority because the subject is specifically dealing with intelligence, one of the most common areas where people tend to overestimate their own abilities. The Dunning-Kruger effect, a related concept, suggests that people with average abilities are often particularly prone to overestimating their relative competence.

Illusory Superiority,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"This situation appears to be a clear example of Illusory Superiority, and interestingly, it seems to be present in both individuals:

1. The narrator demonstrates Illusory Superiority by:
- Believing they possess superior ""generalized intelligence""
- Dismissing formal education while elevating their own perceived natural intelligence
- Making subjective assertions about what constitutes ""true intelligence"" (being funny, interesting, etc.)
- Assuming their way of measuring intelligence is more valid than conventional metrics

2. The cousin shows potential Illusory Superiority through:
- Demanding recognition of her superior intelligence
- Using her PhD as definitive proof of higher intelligence
- Needing external validation of her intelligence
- Reacting emotionally when her perceived superiority is challenged

The situation perfectly exemplifies Illusory Superiority because both parties believe they are above average in intelligence and each dismisses the other's metrics for measuring intelligence while elevating their own preferred measures. This is classic cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities while underestimating others'.

Illusory Superiority,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"This situation doesn't appear to be an example of Illusory Superiority. Illusory Superiority (also known as the above-average effect) is a cognitive bias where people overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. 

In this case, the person isn't claiming to be better than others or overestimating their abilities. Instead, they're describing a specific situation where they made a self-preserving choice and are questioning whether that choice was morally correct. They're actually showing some self-doubt by asking if they're the asshole and acknowledging that many people think they were wrong.

If anything, this is more of a moral dilemma or ethical question about loyalty versus personal responsibility, rather than a case of someone believing they're superior to others.

Illusory Superiority,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Illusory Superiority**, let's first define the concept and then analyze the scenario.

### **What is Illusory Superiority?**
Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias in which individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities compared to others. This can manifest in areas like intelligence, competence, or moral virtue. A key aspect is that the person believes they are *better than average* in some way, even when evidence suggests otherwise. 

### **Analysis of the Scenario:**
1. **The Mother’s Behavior:**  
   - The mother demands a personalized Facebook post despite receiving a full day of attention, gifts, and affection.  
   - She dismisses all the tangible acts of love and focuses on the absence of a social media gesture.  
   - She portrays herself as the victim (""I must not mean all that much to you"") and recruits others (father, family) to validate her feelings.  
   - She has a pattern of deflecting accountability (playing dumb, using tears) when confronted about her behavior.  

2. **Does This Reflect Illusory Superiority?**  
   - The mother seems to believe that her expectations (the Facebook post) are more valid than the daughter’s actual efforts (a full day of celebration).  
   - She positions herself as morally or emotionally superior (""disrespectful daughter"") while dismissing the daughter’s perspective.  
   - Her inability to acknowledge the daughter’s efforts suggests she overestimates her own entitlement and undervalues the daughter’s contributions.  

However, **this scenario leans more toward narcissistic or emotionally manipulative behavior** rather than a classic case of illusory superiority. The mother is not necessarily overestimating her general abilities or virtues but is instead **focused on control, validation, and maintaining a self-centered narrative**.  

### **Conclusion:**
While there are elements of self-centeredness and unrealistic expectations, the core issue is less about the mother believing she is *objectively superior* in a general sense and more about **manipulative and entitled behavior**. Thus, this is not a clear-cut example of illusory superiority.

**Illusory superiority** refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities or abilities relative to others (e.g., believing they are smarter, more competent, or more ethical than average). The example here, however, centers on **delusional paranoia**—a fixed, false belief not grounded in reality—rather than an inflated self-assessment of personal traits or skills. The individual is not claiming superiority over others but instead is convinced of a conspiratorial reality that others do not perceive.

Thus, while the example demonstrates a disconnect from reality, it is not an instance of illusory superiority.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The scenario you described does **not** appear to be an instance of **Illusory Superiority**. Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities or abilities relative to others (e.g., thinking they are smarter, more skilled, or more talented than they actually are). In your example, the sister's behavior seems more related to a lack of self-awareness or social etiquette regarding gift-giving rather than a belief that her paintings are objectively superior to other gifts. 

Here’s why:
1. **No evidence of superiority belief**: There’s no indication that the sister thinks her paintings are *better* than store-bought gifts or that she believes her artistic skills are exceptional. She may simply enjoy making them or assume others will appreciate the effort, even if the result is subpar.
2. **Possible motivations**: Her behavior could stem from frugality, habit, or a sentimental attachment to handmade gifts rather than a delusion of being a great artist. The fact that she spends freely on herself but gives low-effort gifts might suggest thoughtlessness or misplaced priorities, not a superiority complex.
3. **Social norms vs. bias**: The issue here is a mismatch in gift-giving expectations, not necessarily a false belief in her own excellence. Illusory superiority would require her to actively believe her paintings are *good* (or better than alternatives), which isn’t clearly demonstrated.

If she were insisting her paintings were masterpieces or criticizing others’ gifts as inferior, that might fit. But as presented, this is more about poor gift etiquette or lack of consideration.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"This example appears to be an instance of **Illusory Superiority**, also known as the **Dunning-Kruger effect** or the **""above-average effect.""** Illusory Superiority refers to a cognitive bias in which individuals overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or performance relative to others. 

Here’s why the example fits:

1. **Overestimation of Intelligence**: Your friend claims to be smarter than 95% of the population, a statistically improbable assertion unless he has objective evidence (e.g., standardized test scores in the top percentile). His belief aligns with the bias of overestimating one’s own intellectual standing.

2. **Contrast with Reality**: You and your mutual friends recognize that while he is not unintelligent, he is far from a genius. This discrepancy between his self-perception and others’ perceptions is characteristic of Illusory Superiority.

3. **Dismissal of Others**: His habit of calling people ""stupid"" or dismissing disagreements with comments like *""You just don’t understand""* suggests a tendency to elevate himself while undervaluing others’ perspectives—a hallmark of this bias.

4. **Defensiveness**: When challenged, he becomes upset, which is common when deeply held (but unfounded) self-assessments are questioned. This defensiveness often accompanies illusory superiority, as the individual struggles to reconcile their self-view with external feedback.

While your friend may have moments of humility, his occasional claims of intellectual superiority—especially without substantiation—fit the pattern of Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"This scenario appears to be an instance of **Illusory Superiority** (also known as the ""Dunning-Kruger effect"" or the ""above-average effect""), where individuals overestimate their own abilities or qualities relative to others. Here’s why:

1. **Self-Perception of Intelligence**: The narrator describes himself as possessing ""generalized intelligence"" (quick-witted, adaptable, open-minded, exploratory) while dismissing his cousin’s intelligence as niche-specific and lacking originality. This reflects a subjective bias where he elevates his own traits as markers of ""true"" intelligence while downplaying hers (e.g., equating her PhD with mere hard work rather than intellectual rigor). His claim that ""every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and interesting"" is a self-serving generalization that aligns his self-image with his preferred definition of intelligence.

2. **Dismissal of Credentials**: Despite his cousin’s PhD—a formal recognition of expertise—the narrator dismisses its relevance to intelligence, implying his own broader, untested self-assessment is more valid. This aligns with illusory superiority, where people undervalue objective metrics in favor of subjective self-evaluation.

3. **Cousin’s Reaction**: While the cousin’s demand for validation is insecure, her outburst doesn’t necessarily indicate illusory superiority on her part; it may stem from frustration at being dismissed. However, the narrator’s insistence that his disputation wouldn’t bother a ""truly confident"" person is another self-aggrandizing claim—he positions himself as the calm, rational party while pathologizing her reaction.

4. **Comparative Judgment**: The narrator’s belief that he’s superior in generalized intelligence, despite lacking specialized credentials, mirrors the Dunning-Kruger effect, where individuals with limited competence overestimate their abilities relative to others (e.g., assuming adaptability or wit outweighs domain-specific expertise).

**Conclusion**: The narrator’s behavior exemplifies illusory superiority by consistently rating his own intelligence more favorably than his cousin’s based on subjective criteria while minimizing her accomplishments. The cousin’s actions, while confrontational, don’t clearly reflect the same bias.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of **Illusory Superiority**, let's first define the concept. Illusory Superiority (also known as the ""above-average effect"") is a cognitive bias wherein individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. This often leads people to believe they are better than average in areas like intelligence, competence, or moral behavior, even when evidence suggests otherwise.

In the given scenario, the narrator demonstrates several behaviors that *could* hint at Illusory Superiority:
1. **Self-justification**: They emphasize their own preparedness (e.g., bringing a small backpack that always complies with airline rules) while criticizing their fiancé's lack of foresight. This implies a belief in their superior travel wisdom.
2. **Moral defensiveness**: They defend their actions (denying association with their fiancé to avoid being removed from the plane) by appealing to external validation (their boss and coworkers' reliance on them) rather than acknowledging potential moral failings or selfishness.
3. **Dismissal of others' perspectives**: The narrator downplays the disapproval of ""almost everyone"" they know, focusing instead on the approval of their workplace, which aligns with their self-interest.

However, the core of Illusory Superiority is an *inflated self-assessment* relative to objective reality or others' perceptions. Here, the narrator's question (""AITA?"") suggests some self-doubt or awareness that their actions might be questionable, which contrasts with the unshakable self-assurance typical of Illusory Superiority. They also acknowledge the widespread criticism they received, which indicates they are not entirely dismissing others' judgments. 

While the narrator displays some self-serving biases, their willingness to question their own behavior (""am I the asshole?"") and the lack of clear evidence that they believe themselves *superior* (rather than merely *pragmatic*) makes this a weaker fit for Illusory Superiority. The primary conflict is about situational ethics, not an inflated self-view.

ANSWER: No",no,yes,0.0
Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this example is an instance of illusory superiority. First, I need to remember what illusory superiority means. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities compared to others. They might think they're better than average in certain aspects when they're not.

Now, looking at the scenario here. The person did a lot for their mom on Mother's Day—took her out, gave gifts, wrote a heartfelt post. The mom gets upset because she didn't get a specific Facebook post dedicated to her. The daughter feels unappreciated and calls her mom ungrateful, leading to a conflict. The mom then plays the victim, according to the side note, using tears or pretending not to remember hurtful comments.

So, where does illusory superiority come into play here? The daughter might think she did everything right, perhaps overestimating her own efforts compared to what's expected. But wait, the mom's reaction seems more about wanting public recognition (the Facebook post) and dismissing the daughter's efforts. The daughter feels her actions were sufficient, while the mom has different expectations. 

Alternatively, maybe the mom's behavior is the example. The mom might believe her own needs (the Facebook post) are more important than the actual gestures, thinking her perspective is more valid. But illusory superiority is about self-assessment compared to others. The mom is demanding attention, maybe thinking her status as a mother entitles her to a public display. But is that illusory superiority, or just being demanding?

The daughter's reaction—calling her mom ungrateful and initiating a timeout—could stem from believing her own efforts are superior to what her mom's response should be. She might think she's gone above and beyond, so her mom's complaint is unjust. But illusory superiority would involve the daughter thinking she's better than others (like other children) in treating their moms, but the scenario doesn't mention comparing herself to others. It's more about the conflict between her actions and her mom's expectations.

Hmm. Another angle: the mom's tendency to play the victim and not take responsibility. Does she have an inflated view of herself, thinking she can't be wrong? Maybe, but that's more about self-justification than illusory superiority. Illusory superiority isn't just about refusing to admit fault; it's about overestimating one's own traits relative to others.

In this case, the key elements are the daughter's extensive efforts, the mom's focus on a Facebook post, and the resulting conflict. The daughter feels unappreciated, but does that relate to her overestimating her own actions as superior? Or is it a case of mismatched expectations? The mother's behavior might not be illusory superiority either. It's more about her desire for public acknowledgment and using emotional manipulation.

So maybe the answer here is no. The example doesn't clearly show either party overestimating their own abilities or qualities compared to others. Instead, it's a conflict arising from different expectations and communication issues. The daughter believes her actions were sufficient, the mom wants something else. The mother's manipulative tactics (tears, playing victim) are more about avoiding accountability than thinking she's superior. Therefore, this scenario isn't a clear instance of illusory superiority.
</think>

The scenario described does not clearly exemplify **Illusory Superiority**. Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities, abilities, or contributions relative to others, often believing they are ""above average"" in areas where objective evidence does not support this. 

In this case, the conflict arises from mismatched expectations and communication issues rather than an inflated self-assessment. The daughter believes her efforts (spending the day together, gifts, a general Mother’s Day post) were sufficient to express gratitude, while the mother prioritizes a personalized public acknowledgment (a dedicated Facebook post). The daughter’s frustration stems from feeling unappreciated for her tangible efforts, not from an overestimation of her own virtues compared to others. Similarly, the mother’s insistence on a post may reflect a desire for validation or social recognition, but this does not inherently indicate she views herself as superior to others. Her manipulative tendencies (e.g., using tears, playing the victim) align more with emotional avoidance or guilt-tripping rather than a belief in her own superiority.

Neither party’s behavior directly illustrates a distorted self-assessment relative to others, which is central to illusory superiority. Instead, the conflict is rooted in differing values (private gestures vs. public displays) and relational dynamics.

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the given example is an instance of illusory superiority. First, I need to recall what illusory superiority means. From what I remember, illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities compared to others. It's like when someone thinks they're better than average in driving, intelligence, etc., when statistically that's not possible for everyone.

Now, looking at the example provided. The person is talking about believing that undercover agents are following them, hidden cameras are around, and that voices in their head are revealing secrets about aliens and organizations like the FBI. They also mention being removed from a group chat as proof that others are covering up. 

Wait, so illusory superiority involves a self-assessment where someone rates themselves higher than others. But in this case, the person isn't exactly talking about their own abilities or traits. Instead, they're experiencing paranoid delusions—believing they're being watched, that secret organizations are after them, and that they have special knowledge (like the location of aliens) that others don't. This sounds more like symptoms of a mental health issue, perhaps paranoid schizophrenia or a similar condition, rather than a cognitive bias related to self-perceived superiority.

But wait, could there be a connection? The person does believe they have unique, important information that others don't (knowing where the aliens are), which might make them feel superior. However, the core of illusory superiority is about overestimating one's own positive traits relative to others. Here, the belief seems to stem from delusions rather than a general overestimation of one's abilities or characteristics. The person's conviction is based on auditory hallucinations (voices) and paranoia, not on a biased self-assessment of their skills or virtues.

Another angle: the individual might think they're more perceptive than others because they've ""connected all the dots"" that others haven't. But again, this is rooted in delusional thinking rather than a typical overconfidence in their actual abilities. The example seems to describe a psychotic episode rather than a simple cognitive bias.

So, the key difference here is the presence of delusions and hallucinations versus a general overestimation of one's own positive attributes. Illusory superiority is a common bias, but the example provided seems to go beyond that into the realm of mental health disorders. Therefore, the example isn't an instance of illusory superiority but rather a manifestation of paranoid delusions.
</think>

The example provided does not align with the concept of **Illusory Superiority**. Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own positive qualities, skills, or abilities relative to others (e.g., believing they are smarter, more competent, or morally better than average). This bias typically involves self-enhancement in domains like intelligence, driving ability, or social skills, often without objective evidence.

In the given scenario, the individual describes paranoid delusions (e.g., being monitored by undercover agents, hidden cameras, and hearing voices) and a belief in possessing exclusive, critical knowledge (e.g., the location of aliens). These ideas are rooted in **psychotic symptoms**, such as auditory hallucinations (""voices""), persecutory delusions, and referential thinking (interpreting mundane events as personally significant, like being removed from a group chat as ""proof"" of a conspiracy). The narrative reflects a break from reality, which is characteristic of conditions like schizophrenia or delusional disorder, rather than a general overestimation of personal traits or abilities.

While the person may feel uniquely important due to their perceived secret knowledge, this is not illusory superiority. Instead, it stems from delusional beliefs and disordered thought processes. Illusory superiority involves a distorted but non-psychotic self-assessment, whereas this example illustrates a profound detachment from reality. The core issue here is **paranoia and psychosis**, not a biased self-evaluation of one’s competence or virtues.

It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of illusory superiority. First, I need to remember what illusory superiority means. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities compared to others. So, like when someone thinks they're better than they actually are, especially in areas like driving, intelligence, or skills.

Looking at the example here: the sister-in-law keeps giving handmade paintings that the poster thinks are terrible. The sister-in-law seems to believe her gifts are good enough, maybe even better than store-bought items, despite the recipients not appreciating them. The key point here is whether she has an inflated sense of her artistic abilities. If she thinks her paintings are great when they're actually not, that's illusory superiority. 

But wait, maybe there's another angle. The sister might not think her art is amazing but gives it anyway because she values the sentimental aspect. However, the poster mentions that the sister continues to do this even when others give her actual gifts from her wishlist, and she doesn't adjust her behavior. The sister's response when told about the Amazon wishlist (""I made it"") suggests she's confident her handmade gift is a good choice, perhaps better than buying something. That confidence despite the recipients' lack of appreciation could indicate she overestimates the quality or desirability of her gifts. 

Another point: the sister's financial choices. She spends a lot on dining out and maintaining a lifestyle but can't afford to quit her job. The poster judges this a bit, but how does that tie into illusory superiority? Maybe not directly. The main issue is the sister's belief in her gift-giving. If she thinks her paintings are good gifts (better than what others give), then yes, that's the bias. But if she's just being cheap or doesn't realize they're bad, maybe not. But the key in illusory superiority is the self-overestimation. So if she genuinely believes her art is good, then yes. But if she's aware they're not great but gives them for other reasons (tradition, budget), then no. 

The sister's persistence despite never getting positive feedback (since the gifts are hidden) might indicate she's not aware of how others perceive her art. She might think she's better at it than she actually is. So in this case, the sister's behavior aligns with illusory superiority because she continues to give these gifts under the belief that they are valuable or appreciated, overestimating her own artistic skill compared to others' actual reception.
</think>

The example provided does not clearly demonstrate **illusory superiority** as the primary issue. Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or contributions relative to others (e.g., believing one is a better driver, artist, or gift-giver than they objectively are). In this scenario, the sister-in-law’s behavior centers on **gift-giving practices**, not necessarily a self-assessment of her artistic talent. 

Key considerations:
1. **Artistic Skill vs. Gift Intent**: The sister-in-law may not believe her paintings are objectively ""good"" in a technical sense but values the sentimental or personal effort behind handmade gifts. Her persistence could stem from prioritizing thoughtfulness over skill, misunderstanding social norms, or financial constraints (despite evidence of other spending habits). There is no explicit indication she views her art as superior to store-bought items or believes her skill exceeds reality.
2. **Social Awareness Gap**: The issue lies in a mismatch between her perception of acceptable gift-giving and the recipients’ expectations. This could reflect a lack of awareness or empathy rather than an inflated self-view. For example, she might assume her effort compensates for quality, not recognizing that recipients prioritize utility or requested items.
3. **Financial Choices**: Her reluctance to adjust spending habits to stay home with her child highlights a prioritization conflict, not necessarily self-overestimation. This is tangential to illusory superiority unless she explicitly believes her financial decisions are objectively better than others’ (which the example does not establish).

While the sister-in-law’s actions are frustrating and socially tone-deaf, they do not conclusively illustrate illusory superiority. The core issue is a disconnect in gift-giving norms and communication, not a demonstrated overestimation of her own abilities relative to others. Without evidence that she genuinely believes her paintings are high-quality or superior to alternatives, the bias cannot be definitively applied.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of illusory superiority. I need to recall what illusory superiority means. From what I remember, illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities compared to others. It's like when someone thinks they're better than average in areas like intelligence, driving skills, etc., even when they aren't.

In the example, the friend claims he's smarter than 95% of the population. That's a high percentile. The average person would be around 50%, so claiming 95% is way above average. But wait, maybe he's actually smart? The narrator says he's not a dummy but far from a genius. Mutual friends agree. So the friend's self-assessment is probably inflated.

The friend also makes snobby comments about others being stupid and dismisses disagreements by saying others don't understand. That sounds like he's overestimating his own intelligence while underestimating others. The key here is the discrepancy between his actual ability and his self-perception. Since illusory superiority is about overestimating oneself relative to others, this seems to fit. The friend's belief that he's in the top 5% when others don't see him that way would be a case of this bias. Even though he's sometimes humble, those occasional grandiose claims fit the pattern. So yes, this looks like illusory superiority.
</think>

The scenario described appears to be a clear example of **illusory superiority**, a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or performance relative to others. Here’s why:

1. **Overestimation of Intelligence**: The friend claims to be smarter than 95% of the population, a statistically extreme assertion. Even if he were above average, placing oneself in the top 5% implies exceptional intellectual prowess, which the narrator and mutual friends dispute. This gap between self-perception and external evaluation aligns with the core of illusory superiority.

2. **Contempt for ""Average"" People**: The friend’s habit of disparaging others as ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" reinforces the bias. By devaluing others, he elevates his self-image, a common tactic in illusory superiority to justify perceived superiority. His dismissal of disagreements with phrases like “You just don’t understand” further reflects an inflated sense of his own insight.

3. **Inconsistent Humility**: While described as ""humble"" at times, the friend’s occasional grandiose claims reveal a disconnect between his self-view and reality. Illusory superiority often coexists with moments of modesty but is marked by overconfidence in specific domains—here, intelligence and competence in his field.

4. **Defensive Reactions**: The friend’s sensitivity to scrutiny (e.g., becoming upset when challenged) suggests his self-assessment is emotionally charged rather than evidence-based. This defensiveness is typical when deeply held biases are questioned, as the individual struggles to reconcile their self-image with external feedback.

The friend’s belief in his exceptional intelligence, coupled with a tendency to belittle others and resist criticism, strongly aligns with the psychological mechanisms of illusory superiority. His self-rating as superior to 95% of people—without objective justification—exemplifies the bias’s hallmark: an unrealistic, self-serving overestimation of personal merit.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the example given is an instance of illusory superiority. First, I need to remember what illusory superiority means. From what I recall, it's a cognitive bias where a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities compared to others. Like when someone thinks they're better than average in a certain area when they're not.

So looking at the example: the user (25m) and his cousin (28f) with a PhD in computer science. The user was seen as the smart one growing up, but the cousin got a PhD while he became a filmmaker. He thinks she's smart in her niche but lacks generalized intelligence traits like being quick-witted, adaptable, open-minded, etc. He also mentions that every truly intelligent person he's met is funny and interesting, which he doesn't see in her. He calls her a 'sweat' (maybe a typo for 'sweat' as in hard worker, or 'sweet' but contextually 'sweat' here probably means someone who works hard but isn't naturally talented). 

The cousin demands he admit she's smarter, he refuses, and they argue. He points out her needing validation shows insecurity. Now, the user is asking if he's the AH, but the main question here is whether this is an example of illusory superiority.

So, illusory superiority would involve one person overestimating their own intelligence relative to others. The user here believes that despite her PhD, she's not more intelligent than him because he values different traits (generalized vs specialized). He's judging her intelligence based on his own criteria (humor, adaptability, etc.), which might not align with traditional measures like academic achievement. But is he overestimating his own intelligence compared to her?

The cousin also claims she's smarter, but she has a PhD and works in a quant field. However, the user's assessment of her might be biased. If he's dismissing her academic and professional achievements as not indicative of true intelligence (as he defines it), while considering himself more intelligent based on his own criteria, that could be an example of illusory superiority. Because he's creating a definition of intelligence that favors his strengths (generalized traits) and downplays hers (specialized knowledge and hard work). This way, he maintains the belief that he's superior in intelligence despite her credentials.

Alternatively, maybe the cousin is also displaying illusory superiority by insisting she's smarter based on her PhD. But the question is about the user's example. The user's belief that his type of intelligence is the 'true' one, leading him to conclude he's not less intelligent than her, even though she has a PhD, might be a case of him overestimating his own intelligence relative to hers. That would fit illusory superiority. 

Another angle: the user's criteria for intelligence might be subjective. He associates traits like being funny and interesting with intelligence, which are not necessarily objective measures. By defining intelligence in a way that he excels in, he's possibly inflating his own standing. This self-serving bias could be part of illusory superiority.

So putting it all together, the user's assessment of his own intelligence compared to his cousin's, based on his personal criteria that favor his strengths, while dismissing her achievements, suggests he might be experiencing illusory superiority. Therefore, the example likely is an instance of that concept.
</think>

The scenario described can be interpreted as an instance of **illusory superiority** on the part of the narrator. Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or intelligence relative to others, often by selectively defining criteria that favor their strengths while dismissing those that do not. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Redefining Intelligence to Favor the Self**:  
   The narrator acknowledges their cousin’s academic achievements (a PhD in computer science and quant work at a hedge fund) but dismisses these as markers of ""true"" intelligence. Instead, they redefine intelligence to emphasize traits like humor, adaptability, and open-mindedness—qualities they associate with themselves as a filmmaker. By shifting the goalposts of what constitutes intelligence, the narrator elevates their own perceived strengths while minimizing the cousin’s specialized expertise. This aligns with illusory superiority, as the narrator’s self-assessment hinges on subjective criteria that validate their self-image.

2. **Dismissal of Competing Metrics**:  
   The cousin’s demand for recognition of her intelligence (based on her PhD and career) clashes with the narrator’s refusal to equate academic or professional success with ""true"" intelligence. The narrator’s insistence that generalized traits (e.g., being ""quick-witted"") matter more than specialized achievement suggests a bias toward self-serving definitions. This dismissal of alternative metrics reinforces the narrator’s belief in their own superiority, even in the face of objective accomplishments by the cousin.

3. **Projection of Insecurity**:  
   The narrator critiques the cousin’s need for validation as evidence of insecurity, yet their own refusal to acknowledge her intelligence—despite her credentials—could reflect a defensive overestimation of their own capabilities. By framing the cousin’s reaction as emotional (""flying off the handle"") while positioning themselves as rational, the narrator further entrenches their self-perceived intellectual dominance, a hallmark of illusory superiority.

4. **Comparative Self-Enhancement**:  
   The narrator’s assertion that ""every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and interesting"" implicitly positions themselves as meeting this standard, while the cousin does not. This reflects a tendency to judge others harshly against idealized traits while exempting oneself from similar scrutiny, a common feature of illusory superiority.

The cousin’s behavior (e.g., demanding validation) may also reflect elements of insecurity or competitiveness, but the question focuses on whether the **narrator’s perspective** exemplifies illusory superiority. By constructing a subjective hierarchy of intelligence that privileges their own attributes and diminishes the cousin’s, the narrator demonstrates a classic case of this bias.

Illusory Superiority,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of illusory superiority. First, I need to remember what illusory superiority means. From what I recall, illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities compared to others. It's like when someone thinks they're better than average in a skill or trait when they're not.

Looking at the example given: the person (the narrator) is recounting an incident where they and their fiancé had a problem with a carry-on bag. The narrator followed the rules with a small backpack, while the fiancé didn't listen and brought a larger bag that caused issues. When the authorities came, the narrator denied knowing the fiancé to avoid getting kicked off the plane. Now, the narrator is wondering if they're the asshole, but their coworkers support them because they needed to be back on time.

So, does this scenario involve illusory superiority? Let's break it down. The narrator believes they made the right choice by following the rules (small bag) and that their actions were justified to meet work commitments. They also mention that their coworkers agree with them, but others (fiancé, friends) think they're wrong. The key here is whether the narrator is overestimating their own judgment compared to others, especially the fiancé. 

The narrator clearly thinks their approach (following the rules) was superior, and the fiancé's was not. They might believe their decision to deny the relationship was the correct one, perhaps viewing themselves as more responsible or pragmatic. However, illusory superiority isn't just about being right in a situation; it's about an inflated self-assessment relative to others. The narrator's belief that their method was better could be a realistic assessment if they actually were correct (since their bag didn't cause issues). But if they're overestimating their own correctness or downplaying their fiancé's perspective without valid reasons, that might lean into the bias.

Another angle: the narrator's coworkers agree with them. But coworkers might have a vested interest (needing the narrator back for work), so their agreement might not be an objective measure. The narrator might be using this to justify their actions, possibly ignoring the social and relational aspects where others (fiancé, friends) see them as wrong. If the narrator thinks they're in the right despite others' valid criticisms, that could be illusory superiority. However, the situation here seems more about a specific action (denying the relationship) rather than a general overestimation of their abilities or traits.

Wait, but illusory superiority is a general bias, not just about a single event. The example here is a specific incident. The narrator might be justifying their actions, but does that tie into a broader self-assessment where they see themselves as better than others? The story shows they followed the rules and the fiancé didn't. They might think they're more experienced or smarter about travel, which could be a case of illusory superiority if they overstate their competence relative to others. For example, if they believe they're always better at handling travel situations compared to others, especially the fiancé, that would fit. But the example is a single instance. However, the narrator does mention ""done a lot of traveling so why fight the system,"" indicating they think their experience makes their approach better. That could be a valid assessment based on experience, but if they're overestimating their own judgment compared to others (like the fiancé) in a way that's not accurate, then it would be illusory superiority.

Alternatively, the fiancé's mistake was real (the bag was too big), so the narrator's assessment of the situation might be accurate. If their judgment is correct, then it's not an illusion. Illusory superiority involves a misjudgment. So the key is whether the narrator's belief in their superior approach is accurate or inflated.

In this case, the narrator's approach worked (they didn't get kicked off), while the fiancé's didn't. So their belief in their method's superiority might be based on actual outcomes. But perhaps they're attributing the outcome solely to their own superior judgment, ignoring other factors (like luck or the specific airline employee's mood). If they think they're better than others (like the fiancé) in general because of this, that could be illusory superiority. However, the example given is a single event where their approach was correct. Unless they generalize this to a broader sense of superiority beyond the specific incident, it might not be illusory superiority. 

The question is whether the example illustrates the concept. The main point of the story is the narrator's decision to deny their fiancé to avoid getting kicked off. The coworkers agree, others don't. The narrator's defense is their responsibility to work. The illusory superiority would come in if the narrator believes they are better (more responsible, smarter) than others (like the fiancé) in a way that's not accurate. But in this case, the narrator's actions did lead to a better outcome (they stayed on the flight for work), so their assessment might be accurate. Therefore, it's not an illusion but a correct evaluation.

Alternatively, maybe the narrator's belief that they were right to abandon their fiancé in that moment is an overestimation of their own priorities (work over relationship) being superior. If they think their choice was morally better or more correct, despite others (fiancé, friends) disagreeing, that could be a form of illusory superiority. For example, if they think their commitment to work is more important than supporting their partner, and they believe this makes them superior, even though others see it as wrong. But illusory superiority is about self-assessment compared to others in abilities or traits, not necessarily moral judgments.

Hmm. So the key factors are: overestimating one's own abilities/qualities relative to others. The narrator's belief that their approach to travel (small bag) is better because of their experience, leading to a better outcome. If they think they're better at traveling than their fiancé, that could be accurate (since their bag was allowed), but if they overstate this into a general superiority, then yes. However, the story doesn't explicitly say the narrator thinks they're better than others in general, just that their method worked here. 

The part where the coworkers agree and others don't might indicate that the narrator is in a situation where their in-group (coworkers) supports them, but others don't. That's more about group dynamics than individual superiority. 

Alternatively, the narrator's quick decision to deny their fiancé might be seen as a self-preservation instinct, not necessarily tied to a belief in superiority. Unless they rationalize it as a smarter or better choice because they're more responsible, which they do mention (giving their word to be back on time). So if they believe their responsibility to work makes their choice superior, despite the relational cost, that could be a form of moral superiority, which might be a related concept but not exactly illusory superiority.

Wait, illusory superiority typically refers to overestimating one's positive traits or abilities compared to others. For example, most people think they're better drivers than average. In this case, the narrator's actions might stem from a belief that their judgment (about the bag and about self-preservation) is better than their fiancé's. If they truly believe they made the right choice and others (like friends) are wrong, perhaps because they overvalue their own perspective, that could be illusory superiority. But the situation might just be a conflict of priorities (work vs. relationship) rather than a cognitive bias.

So, to sum up: The example might not clearly illustrate illusory superiority because the narrator's assessment of their travel strategy being better was accurate (their bag was allowed, fiancé's wasn't). Their decision to prioritize work over their fiancé in the moment could be a moral or situational choice, not necessarily an overestimation of their own abilities. However, if the narrator believes they are generally superior in decision-making or responsibility compared to others (like the fiancé), then it might be. But the example given is a specific incident where their approach worked, so it's more about a correct assessment than an illusion. Therefore, the answer is probably no.
</think>

The scenario described does not clearly exemplify **illusory superiority**. Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or judgment relative to others, often inaccurately. In this case, the narrator’s belief that their travel strategy (using a small backpack) was superior to their fiancé’s approach appears grounded in practical experience and a correct assessment of airline rules, as evidenced by their seamless boarding. Their actions during the conflict (denying association with their fiancé) were driven by situational self-preservation and a commitment to work obligations, rather than a generalized overestimation of their own virtues or abilities. 

While the narrator may prioritize their professional responsibilities over relational solidarity, this reflects a situational choice rather than a delusional belief in their superiority. The disagreement with others (e.g., friends, the fiancé) stems from differing values (work vs. relationship loyalty), not necessarily a cognitive bias. The coworkers’ approval is context-specific and tied to shared goals, not a broad endorsement of the narrator’s inherent superiority. Since the narrator’s judgment about the luggage and their subsequent actions were situationally justified (even if ethically debatable), this does not align with the core definition of illusory superiority, which requires an inflated self-assessment disconnected from reality.

Illusory Superiority,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"The example provided does not directly illustrate the concept of Illusory Superiority. Illusory Superiority is a cognitive bias where an individual overestimates their abilities and qualities in comparison to others. This bias often leads people to believe they are better than the average person in various domains, such as intelligence, driving skills, or moral behavior.

In the scenario described, the conflict between the daughter and her mother revolves around a misunderstanding and differing expectations regarding the expression of appreciation on Mother's Day. The mother feels that her daughter's appreciation was insufficient because it did not include a personalized Facebook post, while the daughter feels that her actions throughout the day were more than enough to show her appreciation. This situation highlights a difference in communication styles and expectations rather than a cognitive bias related to self-perception.

Therefore, the example does not demonstrate Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their abilities and performance relative to others.

The scenario described in the example seems to be more indicative of paranoid ideation or delusional thinking, where the individual believes they are being watched, followed, and spied on by undercover agents and organizations. This type of thinking is more aligned with a delusional disorder or paranoid schizophrenia, rather than Illusory Superiority.

Illusory Superiority,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The concept of Illusory Superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their abilities and qualities in comparison to others. It is often characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance and a belief that one's skills or qualities are superior to those of others.

In the context of the example provided, the sister's behavior does not necessarily indicate Illusory Superiority. While she may believe that her handmade gifts are valuable and appreciated, this belief does not necessarily stem from an inflated sense of self-importance or a belief that her skills are superior to others. Instead, it may simply be a reflection of her personal values and priorities, such as valuing handmade gifts over store-bought items.

I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius.

Illusory Superiority,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"The scenario you've described does not directly illustrate the concept of Illusory Superiority. Illusory Superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their abilities and performance relative to others, often believing they are better than the average person in various domains. This bias can manifest in people thinking they are more intelligent, more skilled, or more competent than they actually are.

In your story, your cousin appears to be quite confident in her intelligence and achievements, which is understandable given her educational background and professional success. Her reaction to your comments about her intelligence could be seen as a defense mechanism rather than an expression of Illusory Superiority. She may genuinely believe she is more intelligent based on her qualifications and accomplishments, and your comments may have been perceived as a personal attack on her self-esteem and identity.

The conflict seems to stem from differing perspectives on what constitutes intelligence and success, rather than a specific instance of Illusory Superiority. Your cousin's reaction might be more indicative of a defensive response to criticism rather than an overestimation of her abilities.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

Catastrophizing,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The concept of catastrophizing refers to the tendency to imagine the worst possible outcome of a situation, often exaggerating the potential consequences and assuming that the outcome will be disastrous. In the given example, the author is reflecting on the consequences of telling a lie about buying a new couch, which eventually unraveled and led to a loss of trust and two friendships.

The author's statement ""Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life?"" suggests that they might be catastrophizing. They are wondering if their perception of the situation is overly negative, and if the consequences of their actions are as severe as they seem. The author's use of the phrase ""ruined my life"" is a strong indication of catastrophizing, as it implies that the situation has had a devastating and irreversible impact on their life.

Furthermore, the author's description of their social circle's reaction, such as being seen as ""fragile, or fake, or both,"" and the loss of two friendships, while significant, might not necessarily be equivalent to their life being ""ruined."" The author's tendency to focus on the worst possible interpretation of the situation, and their assumption that they will be forever known as ""the couch liar,"" also suggests a catastrophizing mindset.

However, it's also possible to argue that the author's concerns are not entirely unfounded, and that the consequences of their actions have indeed had a significant impact on their relationships and social standing. The author's reflection on their actions and their desire to understand whether they are overreacting suggests a level of self-awareness and introspection, which is not typically characteristic of catastrophizing.

Ultimately, while the author's language and tone suggest some elements of catastrophizing, it's also important to acknowledge that the consequences of their actions have been real and significant. The author's situation is complex, and their emotions and concerns are likely multifaceted.

Catastrophizing,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"To determine if the given example is an instance of the concept Catastrophizing, let's first define what Catastrophizing is. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual exaggerates the potential negative consequences of a situation, often assuming the worst-case scenario will occur. This can lead to increased anxiety, stress, and poor decision-making.

In the provided example, the situation revolves around the narrator's decision to back out of a group gathering due to their dietary restrictions and allergies not being considered in the budget. The narrator's friends, particularly H, react negatively to this decision, claiming that it will damage their budget.

To assess if this is an instance of Catastrophizing, we need to examine if the potential negative consequences (in this case, the damage to the budget) are being exaggerated or if the worst-case scenario is being assumed.

The narrator's decision to back out and request a refund is based on legitimate concerns about their dietary restrictions and allergies. H's response, stating that the majority agreed on the budget and that the narrator should ""get over it,"" does not acknowledge the narrator's valid concerns. When the narrator decides not to attend, H and her friends label the narrator as ""petty"" and claim that their decision will cause significant damage to the budget.

In this context, it appears that H and her friends might be engaging in Catastrophizing by exaggerating the potential negative consequences of the narrator's decision. They are assuming that the narrator's withdrawal will have a significant and devastating impact on the budget, rather than exploring alternative solutions or acknowledging the narrator's legitimate concerns.

However, it is essential to note that the example provided is more focused on the social dynamics and conflict rather than the narrator's thought process or emotional response. The narrator does not appear to be exaggerating the potential negative consequences of attending the gathering with a budget that does not accommodate their dietary needs. Instead, they are making a decision based on their own needs and boundaries.

Given this analysis, the example provided does not directly illustrate the narrator engaging in Catastrophizing. Instead, it highlights a conflict between the narrator and their friends, with the friends potentially exaggerating the negative consequences of the narrator's decision.

Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual exaggerates the severity or likelihood of a negative event, often assuming the worst possible outcome. It involves blowing things out of proportion and expecting disastrous consequences.

In the provided scenario, the friend (M41) makes a statement about being smarter than 95% of the population, which the narrator finds amusing and decides to scrutinize. The narrator's reaction is not an example of Catastrophizing because they are not exaggerating the severity or likelihood of a negative event. Instead, they are responding to their friend's claim with skepticism and friendly interrogation.

The friend's statement about being smarter than 95% of the population could be seen as an example of grandiosity or an inflated sense of self-importance, but it is not Catastrophizing. Catastrophizing would involve the friend assuming that not being smarter than 95% of the population would have disastrous consequences, or that being questioned about this claim would lead to severe and far-reaching negative outcomes.

The narrator's response to the friend's claim is not Catastrophizing either. They are simply challenging their friend's statement and pointing out its potential absurdity. The narrator's actions are driven by a desire to bring their friend back down to earth and to discourage grandiose statements, rather than assuming the worst possible outcome.

In conclusion, the example provided does not illustrate Catastrophizing. The friend's claim and the narrator's response do not involve exaggerating the severity or likelihood of a negative event, which is the hallmark of Catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

I just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?",0,"To determine if the given example is an instance of the concept Catastrophizing, we need to understand what Catastrophizing is. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual exaggerates the severity or likelihood of a negative event, often to the point of assuming the worst possible outcome. This can lead to increased anxiety, stress, and emotional distress.

In the provided example, the girlfriend, Jane, becomes upset when the narrator wants to spend time with their friends without her. She insists on coming along, despite knowing it's a no-partners-allowed party and that she doesn't get along with the narrator's friends. When the narrator expresses their disappointment and frustration with how the night turned out, Jane becomes defensive and accuses the narrator of being ""toxic"" for wanting to spend time with their friends alone.

The key aspect to examine is Jane's reaction to the situation. She takes the narrator's statement that she ""ruined"" the night as a personal attack, becoming upset and pulling out the accusation of toxicity. However, the narrator's statement can be seen as a reflection of their genuine feelings about the evening, rather than an exaggeration of the situation's severity.

Jane's reaction, on the other hand, can be viewed as an example of Catastrophizing. She takes the narrator's desire to spend time with their friends as a personal rejection, assuming that it means the narrator doesn't want to spend time with her or that they're trying to exclude her. This assumption leads her to become overly upset and defensive, escalating the situation.

Furthermore, Jane's accusation that the narrator's desire for a night out with friends is ""toxic"" can be seen as an exaggeration of the situation's severity. This label implies a level of malicious intent or harm that is not present in the narrator's actions. By using this term, Jane is catastrophizing the situation, making it seem worse than it actually is.

Therefore, based on Jane's reaction and behavior, it can be argued that this example does indeed contain an instance of Catastrophizing.

In the context of the provided example, the question is whether the statement ""my fiancé (maybe not for much longer)"" is an instance of catastrophizing.

Upon analyzing the situation, it appears that the speaker's comment about their fiancé ""maybe not for much longer"" is a reflection of their current emotional state and the tension in their relationship, rather than an exaggeration of a potential negative outcome. The speaker's actions and the consequences that followed have created a rift in their relationship, and the comment seems to be a genuine expression of uncertainty about the future of their engagement.

However, it can be argued that the speaker's initial thought process and decision-making during the incident at the airport might be related to catastrophizing. When the cop asked if they were together, the speaker's panicked response of ""NO!"" and emphatic shaking of their head could be seen as an exaggerated reaction to the situation. The speaker might have been anticipating a worst-case scenario, such as being thrown off the plane or missing their important project, and reacted impulsively to avoid that outcome.

Despite this potential connection, the primary focus of the example is on the speaker's actions and the consequences that followed, rather than on the anticipation or exaggeration of a negative event.

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

When his wife told him she was going to the party, he seemed a bit grumpy but didn't comment on it. However, after she returned, he accused her of being selfish and not caring about his well-being, stating that she should have stayed home with him instead of having fun.

Harry's reaction can be seen as an overreaction, as his wife didn't abandon him or neglect his needs. She was only gone for a few hours, had made a plan for his care while she was away (leaving him with painkillers, tea, and tissues), and had given him her contact information in case something happened. His assumption that she was having fun at his expense and didn't care about his well-being might be an exaggeration of the situation.

Moreover, Harry's continued sulking and giving his wife the silent treatment for several days after the incident could be indicative of Catastrophizing. He seems to be dwelling on the perceived negative event (being left alone) and is having trouble letting go of his negative emotions, which is a characteristic of Catastrophizing.

Considering these points, it appears that Harry's reaction is an instance of Catastrophizing, as he is exaggerating the severity of the situation and assuming the worst about his wife's intentions.

Catastrophizing,meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?",0,"The concept of catastrophizing refers to the tendency to imagine the worst possible outcome or scenario, often in response to a relatively minor or insignificant event. In the context of the provided example, the husband's reaction to learning about the wife's past relationship with Dan can be seen as an instance of catastrophizing.

When the husband discovered that his wife had a past relationship with Dan, he immediately jumped to conclusions and assumed that this meant his wife was untrustworthy or that their relationship was in jeopardy. He became upset and started calling his wife names, which is an extreme reaction to a relatively minor revelation. The fact that his wife had not told him about Dan before does not necessarily imply that she was hiding something or that she is untrustworthy.

The husband's reaction was disproportionate to the situation, and he failed to consider the fact that his wife's past relationship with Dan had ended years ago and that she had moved on. He also failed to communicate with his wife in a calm and rational manner, instead choosing to lash out at her in front of their family and friends.

Furthermore, the husband's statement that he didn't know if he could trust his wife anymore is an example of catastrophizing, as it implies that the revelation about Dan has somehow compromised the entire relationship. This is an extreme and unwarranted conclusion, and it demonstrates the husband's tendency to imagine the worst possible outcome.

In contrast, the wife's reaction to the situation is more measured and rational. She is upset by her husband's behavior and is ignoring him as a result, but she is not jumping to conclusions or assuming the worst about their relationship.

Catastrophizing,gpt-4o,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The situation you've described does contain elements that can be associated with catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion involving an irrational belief that something is far worse than it actually is. In the example provided, the person is reflecting on the consequences of a lie about owning a couch, which spiraled out of control when more lies were created to cover up the initial falsehood. Eventually, the lie is exposed, leading to feelings of embarrassment and social ostracism.

The person perceives the situation as if their entire social circle views them negatively and uses phrases like ""I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently"" and ""Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life?"" These thoughts suggest exaggeration and jumping to conclusions about the permanence and totality of the social consequences.

Even though there could be real social repercussions for the lie, the belief that it has ""ruined"" life reflects an all-or-nothing thinking pattern and an overestimation of the negative impact. This aligns with catastrophizing, as the individual sees the situation in its worst possible light, attributing severe, life-altering consequences to what is essentially a situation that, while embarrassing and damaging, is not insurmountable.

Therefore, this example can be seen as an instance of catastrophizing, where the person is interpreting the outcomes of their actions in an excessively negative and exaggerated manner.

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward.

Catastrophizing,gpt-4o,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"The concept of ""catastrophizing"" refers to an irrational thought process where a person believes something is far worse than it actually is. It often involves expecting or predicting the worst possible outcome in any given situation, usually without considering other, more realistic possibilities.

In the text provided, the narrator describes a real-life event where they chose to distance themselves from their fiancé during an argument with airline staff to avoid being penalized or delayed themselves. The narrator acknowledges the negative social consequences they faced from friends and family who viewed their actions as inconsiderate, yet they rationalized their behavior by emphasizing the importance of returning to work on time.

While the narrator anticipates negative judgments from others (""I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one""), this anticipation is based on genuine past experiences where people, except for their boss and coworkers, have disapproved of their actions. The narrator is reflecting on potential criticism rather than imagining an unrealistic worst-case scenario without basis.

Catastrophizing,gpt-4o,"Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

It’s been a few days and I thought he’d have calmed down by now but he’s still sulking and I’m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I’m the AH here.",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person irrationally assumes that the worst possible outcome will happen or exaggerates the consequences of a situation.

AITA?",0,"The concept of ""catastrophizing"" refers to an irrational thought process where an individual believes something is far worse than it actually is. It involves anticipating the worst possible outcome, often without substantial evidence supporting such fears. It is a form of cognitive distortion typically associated with anxiety and stress, where a person may turn a relatively small or manageable problem into a much larger and more overwhelming issue in their mind, leading to heightened emotional responses such as despair, anxiety, or panic.

In this scenario, the husband's reaction to discovering that his wife had an ex-boyfriend named Dan, whom he met for the first time at a family gathering, could potentially be seen as an instance of catastrophizing. The husband's strong emotional response—expressing distrust, calling his wife names, and questioning the entire relationship—is disproportionate to the situation. The revelation of the past relationship, which both the wife and Dan seem to have moved past without issue, is not fundamentally detrimental to their current marriage. However, the husband appears to have allowed his concerns and insecurities to escalate significantly beyond what the situation warranted, leading to a very public and intense reaction.

The husband's extreme reaction to the existence of his wife's past relationship, particularly in the absence of any ongoing issues with that relationship, indicates that he may be imagining significant and unresolved problems with their marriage, potentially in a ""catastrophic"" manner. His response exemplifies how a cognitive distortion like catastrophizing might manifest, where a misunderstanding or lack of communication is blown out of proportion, resulting in significant distress and conflict.

In the provided scenario, the boyfriend's statement to his girlfriend, ""she 'ruined' my night,"" might seem like catastrophizing. However, considering the context, it's more of an expression of disappointment and frustration rather than an exaggeration of the event's overall impact on his life. He's unhappy that the dynamic of the night was negatively affected by her presence, but he's not framing it as a life-altering or completely devastating event. His subsequent explanation clarifies that his dissatisfaction stems from the awkward atmosphere and the disruption of the friend-only gathering. Therefore, the boyfriend's language reflects a sense of aggravation and a desire to communicate his feelings, but not necessarily the extreme, irrational thought patterns characteristic of catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

It’s been a few days and I thought he’d have calmed down by now but he’s still sulking and I’m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I’m the AH here.",0,"Catastrophizing involves exaggerating the severity of a situation, imagining the worst possible outcome, and believing that you won't be able to cope with it.

Catastrophizing,gemini-2.0-flash-exp,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.

Catastrophizing,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"While this situation is certainly distressing, the writer's interpretation shows elements of catastrophizing. Here's why:

1. The phrase ""ruined my life"" is an extreme interpretation of the situation. While the lie had real consequences (damaged trust, strained relationships), it hasn't actually ruined their entire life.

2. While some friendships have been affected, they haven't lost their entire social circle. The text mentions losing two friendships and some trust issues, but doesn't indicate complete social isolation.

3. The situation, while uncomfortable and regrettable, is something that can be addressed and improved over time through:
- Showing genuine remorse
- Being consistently honest going forward
- Rebuilding trust gradually
- Learning from the experience

The consequences are real and meaningful, but they're not permanent or life-destroying.

I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"This situation doesn't represent catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing typically involves:
1. Assuming the worst possible outcome
2. Exaggerating the negative consequences of a situation
3. Escalating relatively minor issues into potential disasters

In this case, the husband's reaction shows some elements of catastrophizing because:
- He's treating a 2-hour absence as if it were a major abandonment
- He's interpreting his wife's brief attendance at her siblings' birthday party as evidence that she doesn't care about his well-being
- He's escalating a brief separation while sick (with arrangements made for his comfort) into a betrayal
- He's prolonging the emotional response well beyond the actual event

The husband appears to be catastrophizing by turning a reasonable 2-hour absence (with preparations made for his care) into a major emotional crisis and evidence of his wife's supposed lack of care for him, when in reality she had been caring for him consistently for a week and made appropriate arrangements for her brief absence.

Catastrophizing is an excessive, negative interpretation of events, where one perceives a situation as much worse than it actually is. In this case, the individual is expressing a reasonable concern about their food allergies and dietary restrictions not being considered in the group's budget. They are asking for their money back due to the lack of accommodation for their needs, which is a reasonable request. While the other individuals may view the situation differently, the individual is not catastrophizing the situation by asking for their money back.",,no,

I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0," ANSWER: Yes

In this example, the individual (M32) is engaging in catastrophizing by challenging and scrutinizing his friend's (M41) claim of being smarter than 95% of the population. This response is disproportionate to the initial statement, as it suggests that his friend's intelligence is significantly overstated and questions the validity of his claim. This response can be seen as an exaggerated or extreme reaction to a relatively minor issue, which is a characteristic of catastrophizing. Additionally, the individual's repeated challenges to his friend's intelligence and methods can be seen as a pattern of catastrophizing, as it suggests a tendency to view situations as worse than they actually are.",,no,

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

The behavior described in the example can be considered catastrophizing due to the following reasons:

1. The girlfriend (Jane) perceives the situation as a personal attack, implying that her presence is essential for the OP to have a good time with their friends. This is an exaggerated and disproportionate response to the situation.
2. Jane's reaction to being excluded from the outing is extreme, as she interprets it as toxic and hurtful. This interpretation is a catastrophic interpretation of the situation, as it is not supported by the available information.
3. Jane's insistence on attending the outing, even when it is clear that it is causing discomfort for the OP and their friends, can also be seen as catastrophizing, as she is prioritizing her own desire to be included over the comfort and enjoyment of others.

Overall, the girlfriend's reaction to being excluded from the outing and her insistence on attending, despite the negative impact it has on the group, can be seen as catastrophizing.",,no,

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

AITA?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The behavior described in this example can be considered catastrophizing due to the exaggerated and disproportionate response to a minor issue. The individual's fear of being ""raked over the coals"" for the baggage issue led to a chain of events that resulted in a public argument, the breakup of the relationship, and damaging the trust between the couple. The individual's reaction was out of proportion to the initial problem, and they prioritized their own self-preservation over the well-being of their partner.

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

It’s been a few days and I thought he’d have calmed down by now but he’s still sulking and I’m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I’m the AH here.",0," ANSWER: Yes

The husband's reaction in this situation can be considered an instance of catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person perceives a situation as much worse than it actually is. In this case, Harry is exaggerating the significance of his wife leaving for a short period to attend a family event, turning it into a personal attack on her care and concern for him. This is an example of him catastrophizing the situation, as he is overreacting to her brief absence and interpreting it as a lack of care, when in reality, she was taking care of him by ensuring he had what he needed while she was away.",,no,
Catastrophizing,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

The behavior described in this example can be considered an instance of catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is an exaggerated negative thinking pattern where a person perceives a situation as much worse than it actually is. In this case, the husband's reaction to learning about the past relationship with Dan seems disproportionate to the information he received.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"This example does not appear to be an instance of **Catastrophizing**. Catastrophizing refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual assumes the worst possible outcome will occur or exaggerates the severity of a situation beyond reality. In this case, the individual is reflecting on the actual consequences of their actions—lost trust, damaged friendships, and a tarnished reputation—rather than irrationally magnifying the situation. Their distress stems from real social repercussions, not an exaggerated or imagined worst-case scenario.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"To determine whether this example is an instance of the concept **Catastrophizing**, let's first define what catastrophizing means. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person assumes the worst possible outcome will occur or exaggerates the severity of a situation beyond what is reasonable. It often involves blowing things out of proportion or imagining a ""disaster"" where none is likely to exist.

In the given example, the narrator describes a conflict with their friend **H** over a group event. The narrator has allergies and dietary restrictions, and the budget for the event includes food they cannot eat. When they express their discomfort and decide not to attend, **H** and her friends react by calling the narrator ""petty"" and claiming that their withdrawal will ""do damage to their budget."" 

Here’s the analysis:
1. **Narrator's Perspective**: The narrator is not catastrophizing. They are reacting reasonably to a situation where their needs (allergies/dietary restrictions) are being ignored. Their decision to withdraw and request a refund is a logical response, not an exaggerated or irrational one.
2. **H and Her Friends' Perspective**: They *might* be engaging in catastrophizing by claiming that the narrator's withdrawal will ""do damage to their budget."" This seems like an exaggerated response, as one person's contribution is unlikely to ruin the entire budget for a group of 12. They are framing the situation as far more dire than it likely is.

However, the question asks whether the *example* (the narrator's story) is an instance of catastrophizing. The narrator is not catastrophizing; they are describing a conflict where the other party may be overreacting. The example itself does not primarily illustrate catastrophizing by the narrator.

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person assumes the worst-case scenario or exaggerates the negative aspects of a situation, often blowing things out of proportion. It involves imagining that a minor or manageable problem will lead to disaster or unbearable suffering.

In the given scenario, Harry's reaction to his wife leaving for a few hours to attend her siblings' birthday party could be interpreted as catastrophizing if he is exaggerating the implications of her absence. For example:
- He accuses her of being ""selfish"" and ""not caring about his well-being,"" which suggests he may be interpreting her brief absence as a sign of neglect or abandonment, rather than a reasonable and temporary break.
- He frames her leaving as her ""having fun on [her] own while he was miserable,"" which could imply he views her actions as a personal betrayal or a severe lack of support, rather than a minor and practical decision.
- His prolonged silent treatment and sulking further suggest he is dwelling on the situation as if it were far more significant or harmful than it objectively was.

However, it’s also possible that Harry is simply expressing frustration or feeling neglected, which may not necessarily rise to the level of catastrophizing unless he is explicitly imagining or expressing unrealistic worst-case outcomes (e.g., ""You leaving means you don’t love me anymore"" or ""Now I’ll never recover because you weren’t here""). The example doesn’t include such extreme statements, so it’s more likely that Harry is being overly sensitive or unreasonable rather than catastrophizing.

Thus, while his reaction is disproportionate, it doesn’t clearly fit the definition of catastrophizing unless there’s evidence he is imagining exaggerated, catastrophic consequences.

My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?",0,"The example you provided does **not** appear to be an instance of **catastrophizing**. Catastrophizing refers to a cognitive distortion where an individual assumes the worst possible outcome will occur, often blowing a situation out of proportion in their mind. For example, if your husband had reacted by saying, ""This means our marriage is over, and you’ve been lying to me about everything,"" that would be catastrophizing—jumping to an extreme, irrational conclusion.  

In this case, your husband’s reaction—while intense and inappropriate—seems more like an emotional outburst fueled by surprise, embarrassment, and feelings of betrayal (due to not being informed about your past relationship). His anger and distrust, though disproportionate to the situation, don’t necessarily reflect the kind of irrational, exaggerated thinking characteristic of catastrophizing. Instead, it reads as a heated reaction to perceived dishonesty or secrecy.  

Thus, this is not a clear example of catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of catastrophizing. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I know, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where someone assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, often blowing things out of proportion. It's like when someone thinks a small mistake will lead to complete disaster.

Now, looking at the example. The person told a lie about buying a couch, which spiraled out of control. The consequences were losing friends and being labeled a liar. They end up feeling like their life is ruined. The key here is whether their thinking involves catastrophizing. 

The person admits that the lie led to losing trust, losing friendships, and social stigma. But the question is, are they overreacting by thinking this ruined their life? The example shows real consequences, but maybe the person is exaggerating the long-term impact. For instance, they say ""ruined my life,"" but perhaps the situation is bad but not life-ruining. However, the person also questions if they're overreacting, which might hint at self-awareness. 

Wait, catastrophizing isn't about the actual consequences but the perception of them. Even if there are real problems, if the person views them as catastrophic (e.g., ""this ruined my life""), that's catastrophizing. The example ends with the person wondering if they're overreacting by thinking their life is ruined. So their thought process includes considering that possibility. 

But does the example actually demonstrate the person engaging in catastrophizing? The situation has significant negative outcomes, but the person is reflecting on whether their assessment is accurate. If they believe the lie has ruined their life, that could be catastrophizing. However, the person is also questioning that belief, which might indicate they're not fully engaging in the distortion. Alternatively, even if they're considering the possibility, the fact that they pose the question suggests they might be catastrophizing by viewing the situation as life-ruining when it's a serious but perhaps not catastrophic event. 

Hmm. The key here is whether the person's thoughts are catastrophizing. The example includes real consequences, but the person's evaluation of those consequences as life-ruining might be an overestimation. Even though they lost friends and trust, the term ""ruined my life"" might be an exaggeration. So their conclusion that their life is ruined could be catastrophizing, even if the situation is bad. 

So, the answer would depend on whether the person is exaggerating the impact. The example's last line asks if they're overreacting by thinking it ruined their life. The person's own doubt suggests that the thought might be catastrophizing. Since catastrophizing is about the cognitive distortion of expecting the worst, even if the consequences are bad, thinking it's life-ruining when it's a major problem but not truly life-ending (like losing a job, homelessness, etc.) would fit. 

Therefore, the example does involve catastrophizing because the individual is likely overestimating the negative impact (life-ruining) despite the actual consequences, which are severe but perhaps not as extreme as they perceive.
</think>

The example provided does not primarily illustrate catastrophizing. Catastrophizing involves magnifying or anticipating the worst possible outcomes of a situation, often irrationally, such as assuming a minor problem will lead to utter disaster. In this case, the individual’s distress stems from *actual consequences* of their actions—lost trust, damaged relationships, and social stigma—rather than an exaggerated or irrational fear of potential outcomes. The person acknowledges the real harm caused by their lies and questions whether their belief that this ""ruined [their] life"" is an overreaction. While their guilt and shame are intense, their reflection shows self-awareness and a realistic assessment of the fallout (e.g., strained friendships, social judgment). The consequences, though severe, are grounded in reality rather than imagined or inflated catastrophes. The core issue here is guilt, shame, and the fallout of dishonesty, not a cognitive distortion like catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example provided is an instance of catastrophizing. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I know, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, often blowing things out of proportion. It's like when someone thinks a small problem will lead to a disaster.

Looking at the example given. The person (let's call them the OP) planned a gathering with friends. They saved money, agreed on a budget, and then the friend H made a budget without considering OP's allergies. OP decided not to go and asked for their money back. The friends are upset, and OP is wondering if they're being unreasonable.

Now, to check for catastrophizing. The OP's reaction was to back out of the event because the food options didn't accommodate their allergies. They asked for their money back, leading to conflict. But where's the catastrophizing here? Catastrophizing would be if OP thought that this situation would lead to something much worse, like ""They all hate me now, and I'll never have friends again,"" or ""This will ruin my reputation forever."" 

In the example, OP is reacting to a real issue (allergies not being considered) but doesn't seem to be exaggerating the consequences beyond the immediate problem. They're upset about the food and the money, but there's no indication they're predicting a catastrophic outcome. Instead, they're dealing with the actual problem at hand. The friends' reaction is calling them petty, but OP is just standing their ground. So the thought process here is more about conflict resolution rather than imagining the worst-case scenario.

Wait, but maybe OP is assuming that going would be impossible because they can't eat anything, leading to a disaster? But the friend said there are other things they can eat. OP might be thinking that the options are insufficient, but the friend's response was dismissive. However, the decision to back out is based on the present issue, not an imagined future catastrophe. So it's more of a practical decision rather than catastrophizing.

Therefore, this situation doesn't fit the definition of catastrophizing. The OP isn't blowing things out of proportion; they're responding to a real and present issue with their health (allergies) and financial contribution. The emotional response is conflict with friends, but that's a direct result of their actions, not an imagined catastrophe.
</think>

The example provided does not appear to be an instance of catastrophizing. Catastrophizing involves irrationally predicting or assuming the worst possible outcome of a situation, often magnifying minor issues into imagined disasters. In this scenario, the person (OP) faces a concrete problem: their dietary restrictions and allergies were not accommodated in the group's agreed-upon budget, despite prior discussions. OP's decision to withdraw from the event and request a refund stems from a legitimate concern for their health and well-being, not an exaggerated fear of hypothetical consequences. While there is interpersonal conflict (e.g., being called ""petty""), OP's reaction is grounded in the immediate reality of the situation rather than an irrational escalation of potential outcomes. There is no indication that OP is imagining catastrophic future events (e.g., ""This will ruin all my friendships forever"") but rather addressing a direct issue of unmet expectations and personal needs.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the example given is an instance of catastrophizing. Hmm. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I recall, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, often blowing things out of proportion. It's like expecting a disaster even when there's little evidence for it. For example, if someone makes a small mistake at work and immediately thinks they'll get fired, that's catastrophizing.

Now, looking at the example provided. The friend (M41) claims he's smarter than 95% of the population. The narrator challenges this, leading the friend to get upset. The friend also makes snobby comments about others being stupid and dismisses disagreements by saying others don't understand. The narrator pushes back against his grandiose claims.

Wait, but how does this relate to catastrophizing? The friend here is making grandiose statements about his intelligence, putting others down. Catastrophizing is more about anticipating the worst. The friend's behavior seems more like arrogance or maybe narcissistic tendencies rather than catastrophizing. He's overestimating his abilities and looking down on others, but that's different from expecting the worst possible outcome. 

Alternatively, maybe the friend's reaction to being challenged is catastrophizing. Like, when the narrator laughs and questions him, the friend gets upset. Could the friend be catastrophizing by thinking that being challenged means something terrible, like others don't respect him or he's a failure? But the example doesn't really show the friend's internal thoughts. The main point is the friend's grandiose self-assessment and the narrator's response. 

So, the example's focus is on the friend's inflated self-perception and the narrator's reaction to it. Catastrophizing isn't about thinking you're better than others; it's about expecting the worst. Therefore, this situation doesn't fit. The friend isn't predicting a disaster; he's overestimating his intelligence. The cognitive distortion here might be something else, like overgeneralization (if he thinks most people are dumb based on limited interactions) or maybe grandiosity, which is more related to narcissism. 

Another angle: Could the narrator be catastrophizing? The narrator is challenging the friend's claim, but that's a reaction, not a cognitive distortion. The narrator isn't assuming the worst; they're just pushing back against an exaggerated claim. 

So, putting it all together, the example doesn't seem to involve catastrophizing. The main issue is the friend's grandiose self-assessment and dismissive attitude, which are different cognitive distortions or personality traits. Therefore, the answer is no.
</think>

The example provided does not fit the definition of catastrophizing. Catastrophizing involves anticipating the worst possible outcome in a situation, often irrationally magnifying the negative consequences of an event. For instance, someone might catastrophize by thinking, ""If I fail this test, I’ll never graduate, and my life will be ruined."" It is characterized by an exaggerated focus on potential disasters or extreme negative outcomes, even when evidence does not support such conclusions.

In the scenario described, the friend (M41) displays grandiosity and arrogance by claiming he is smarter than 95% of the population and making dismissive remarks about others’ intelligence. His behavior aligns more with cognitive distortions like overestimation of self, narcissistic tendencies, or possibly overgeneralization (e.g., labeling most people as ""stupid"" based on limited interactions). The narrator’s reaction—challenging the friend’s grandiose claims—is a response to this arrogance rather than an example of catastrophizing. There is no indication in the text that either character is predicting or fixating on catastrophic outcomes. Instead, the conflict centers on the friend’s inflated self-perception and the narrator’s efforts to counter it.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

I just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example provided is an instance of catastrophizing. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I know, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where someone assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, or they blow a situation out of proportion, making it seem much worse than it actually is. It's like when someone thinks a small problem is a disaster.

Looking at the example given: The person (the original poster) is upset because their girlfriend insists on coming to a friends' gathering even though she doesn't get along with the friends. The girlfriend gets upset when not included, leading to an awkward situation when she does come. The OP then tells her she ruined the night, leading to an argument where the girlfriend accuses them of being toxic for wanting a night apart.

So, where's the catastrophizing here? Let's break it down. The girlfriend insists on coming even though she doesn't get along with the friends. Maybe she's assuming that if she doesn't go, something bad will happen, like the OP might drift away, or there's a threat to the relationship. She might be imagining the worst-case scenario if she's not there, like the OP having a better time without her or the friends influencing the OP negatively. That would be catastrophizing because she's anticipating a disaster that isn't necessarily going to happen.

Alternatively, when the OP says the girlfriend ""ruined"" the night, are they catastrophizing? Well, the OP is stating that the night was ruined because the girlfriend was there. But in the context of the term, catastrophizing is more about expecting the worst, not just stating that something bad happened. The OP is recounting an actual event where the presence led to a bad time, so maybe that's not catastrophizing. The girlfriend's reaction, however, might involve catastrophizing. For example, she says it's toxic that the OP wants a night out without her. She might be viewing the desire for separate time as a catastrophic sign for their relationship, thinking that wanting space means the OP doesn't care, leading to the worst possible interpretation (toxic behavior) instead of a normal need for socializing separately.

Wait, the question is whether the example is an instance of catastrophizing. The example is the entire scenario. So we need to check if either party is catastrophizing. The girlfriend's insistence on coming could be based on catastrophic thinking—assuming that not being there would lead to a bad outcome. She might fear that if she's not included, the relationship is in jeopardy. Her reaction when the OP says she ruined the night might involve her interpreting the OP's desire for time apart as a catastrophic event (like the relationship is failing).

Alternatively, the OP's statement that the girlfriend ""ruined"" the night might be an overstatement. But the OP is describing an actual event where the night went badly. So ""ruined"" here might be a strong word, but if the night actually was significantly worse, then it's not catastrophizing. However, if the OP is exaggerating the impact beyond what actually happened (like thinking that this one bad night means the end of the friendship or relationship), that could be catastrophizing. But in the post, the OP is recounting the event as it happened—friends were uncomfortable, the mood was down. So the OP's statement might be an accurate assessment rather than a cognitive distortion.

The main point here is whether the girlfriend's actions or the OP's statements involve catastrophizing. The girlfriend's insistence on coming and her reaction to not being invited might stem from catastrophic thinking. For example, she might believe that not attending the party will lead to the OP neglecting her, or that the OP's friends will turn the OP against her. These are worst-case scenarios that she's imagining, which would be catastrophizing.

So the example does involve catastrophizing, particularly on the girlfriend's part. The girlfriend's behavior and her accusations of toxicity when the OP wants time alone could be based on catastrophic thoughts about the relationship's stability. Therefore, the answer would be yes, this is an instance of catastrophizing.
</think>

The example provided involves analyzing whether the girlfriend's behavior or the original poster's (OP) statements constitute catastrophizing. Catastrophizing refers to anticipating or perceiving a situation as a catastrophic disaster, often by exaggerating its negative implications beyond reality. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Girlfriend's Perspective**:  
   - The girlfriend insists on attending events where she doesn't get along with the OP's friends, despite knowing the gatherings are ""no-partners allowed."" Her insistence and emotional reaction (e.g., accusing the OP of being ""toxic"" for wanting time apart) suggest she may be catastrophizing.  
   - By interpreting the OP's desire for independent social time as a threat to the relationship, she likely assumes the worst-case scenario (e.g., abandonment, neglect, or erosion of trust). This aligns with catastrophizing, as she magnifies the significance of the OP's actions into a catastrophic relationship issue rather than a normal need for separate socializing.  

2. **OP's Statements**:  
   - The OP describes the night as ""ruined"" due to the girlfriend's presence. While this is a strong term, it reflects an actual negative outcome (friends walking on eggshells, a tense atmosphere). The OP is recounting an observed reality rather than irrationally exaggerating hypothetical consequences. Thus, this does not qualify as catastrophizing.  

**Conclusion**: The girlfriend’s behavior—interpreting the OP’s desire for autonomy as inherently toxic and reacting disproportionately—demonstrates catastrophizing. She inflates the situation into a catastrophic threat to the relationship, which fits the definition of this cognitive distortion.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the example provided is an instance of catastrophizing. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I recall, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, often blowing things out of proportion. It's like when someone thinks a minor problem will lead to a disaster.

Looking at the example given. The person here is recounting an incident where their fiancé had an issue with a carry-on bag, leading to her being removed from the plane. The key part related to catastrophizing would be if the person was imagining the worst-case scenario in their thoughts or actions. 

In the story, the narrator mentions that when the cop asked if they were together, they said ""NO!"" to avoid being thrown off the plane. Their reasoning was self-preservation, especially since their boss and coworkers were relying on them to return on time for a project. The fiancé and others think the narrator was an asshole for this reaction. 

Now, does this involve catastrophizing? Let's analyze. The narrator's action (denying the relationship) was based on the immediate fear of being removed from the plane. They anticipated that if they admitted being together, they might also be forced to leave, which would jeopardize their work commitment. But did they catastrophize here? 

Catastrophizing would involve expecting the worst possible outcome beyond what's reasonable. The narrator's fear was that they'd be thrown off the plane if they stayed with their fiancé. Given that the authorities were already removing the fiancé, and the flight was packed, it's plausible that the airline staff would have made them both leave. So the narrator's fear wasn't entirely baseless. However, the extent to which they imagined the consequences (like losing their job, the project failing, etc.) isn't explicitly stated. The focus here is more on the immediate consequence of missing the flight rather than spiraling into worse scenarios like ruining their career or relationship permanently. 

Alternatively, the narrator's thought process when denying the relationship might have been a split-second decision to avoid a bad outcome (getting kicked off), but without necessarily escalating it to a catastrophic level. The example doesn't show them thinking that their entire life would fall apart, just that they needed to be back for work. 

Wait, but maybe the narrator's assumption that not returning on time would lead to severe professional repercussions is a form of catastrophizing. However, the user's question is about whether the example itself is an instance of catastrophizing. The example is the story presented, not the person's thought process. The original post is the person asking if they're the asshole (AITA), not necessarily detailing their cognitive distortions. 

So in the story, the act of denying the relationship might be a reaction to a perceived immediate problem. The catastrophizing would be if the person imagined that not getting back would lead to, say, losing their job, their entire career collapsing, etc., beyond what's realistic. However, the narrator states that their coworkers and boss were relying on them for a time-sensitive project, which is a valid concern. They don't elaborate on worst-case scenarios beyond that. 

Therefore, the example given doesn't clearly illustrate catastrophizing. The person's action was based on a realistic (if perhaps selfish) assessment of the consequences, not an irrational expectation of disaster. Hence, this scenario isn't an instance of catastrophizing.
</think>

The example provided does not clearly demonstrate catastrophizing. Catastrophizing involves irrationally assuming the worst possible outcome, often escalating minor issues into imagined disasters. In this scenario, the narrator's decision to deny their relationship with their fiancé was driven by a desire to avoid immediate consequences (being removed from the flight) and fulfill a work obligation. While their action may be seen as selfish or irresponsible, the reasoning centers on practical concerns (e.g., keeping a promise to return on time for a critical project) rather than an exaggerated or irrational belief that the situation would spiral into extreme, unrealistic consequences (e.g., losing their job, ruining their life). The narrator’s fear of missing the flight and disappointing coworkers is grounded in a specific, time-sensitive professional commitment, not an unfounded catastrophic narrative. Thus, the example lacks the hallmark of catastrophizing: an irrational leap to worst-case scenarios beyond reasonable likelihood.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the example given is an instance of catastrophizing. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I recall, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, often blowing things out of proportion. It's like imagining a small problem turning into a disaster.

Looking at the example: the husband is sick with the flu, and his spouse goes to a birthday party for a couple of hours. The husband gets upset, calls the spouse selfish, and gives the silent treatment. The question is whether his reaction is catastrophizing.

So, the husband's actions—accusing the spouse of not caring, thinking they left him alone while having fun. Is he imagining the worst possible scenario here? Like, maybe he feels abandoned and assumes the spouse doesn't care at all about his well-being. Instead of seeing that the spouse took care of him all week and just took a short break, he might be exaggerating the situation into a bigger issue. He might be thinking that the spouse's action of leaving for a few hours means they don't care, which could be an overestimation of the problem. That fits catastrophizing because he's taking a minor event (spouse leaving for a few hours) and turning it into a major issue (spouse doesn't care about him at all).

But wait, is there another angle? Maybe he's just upset and feeling neglected, but not necessarily catastrophizing. Catastrophizing would involve expecting the worst outcome. For example, if he thought that being left alone would lead to him getting worse, or that the spouse leaving meant the end of their relationship. In the example, he's more accusing the spouse of not caring rather than predicting a catastrophic outcome. Hmm.

Alternatively, his reaction might be an example of emotional reasoning (feeling something is true because of emotions) or overgeneralization (one event applies to everything). But the key here is whether he's blowing the situation out of proportion to a catastrophic level. His accusation that the spouse doesn't care about his well-being might be an overreaction, assuming the worst about the spouse's intentions. If he's thinking that the spouse's actions indicate a lack of care (which is a big, negative conclusion), that could be catastrophizing. Because he's taking the action (leaving for a few hours) and interpreting it as a major sign of neglect or lack of love, which is a worst-case interpretation.

So yes, his reaction seems to involve catastrophizing. He's interpreting the spouse's brief absence as a significant indicator of not caring, which is an exaggerated and catastrophic view of the situation.
</think>

The example provided does **not** clearly illustrate catastrophizing. Catastrophizing involves anticipating or assuming the **worst possible outcome** of a situation, often escalating minor concerns into imagined disasters. For instance, if the husband had said, ""You left me alone, so I’ll probably get even sicker and end up in the hospital, and you won’t care,"" this would reflect catastrophizing. Instead, the husband’s reaction centers on emotional accusations (e.g., calling the spouse ""selfish"") and interpreting the spouse’s brief absence as a sign of neglect. While his response is unreasonable and disproportionate, it stems more from **personalizing** (assuming actions are directed against him) and **black-and-white thinking** (e.g., ""you don’t care about me at all"") rather than catastrophizing. He focuses on perceived intentional harm rather than predicting exaggerated negative consequences.

Catastrophizing,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

Okay, let's see. The question is whether the example given is an instance of catastrophizing. First, I need to remember what catastrophizing means. From what I recall, catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where someone assumes the worst possible outcome will happen, often blowing things out of proportion. It's like when someone thinks a small problem will lead to a disaster.

Looking at the example: The woman (26F) and her husband (28M) attended her mother's birthday party where her ex-boyfriend Dan was present. The husband hadn't met Dan before and didn't know about their past. When introduced, the husband got upset, called her names in front of everyone, and doubted their trust. Now he's apologizing, and she's ignoring him. She's asking if she's the asshole here, but the main question is if this situation involves catastrophizing.

Who is catastrophizing here? The husband's reaction seems intense. He found out about the ex, got angry, called her names, and said he couldn't trust her. Maybe he's jumping to conclusions, thinking that her not telling him about Dan means she's hiding something more, leading him to doubt their entire relationship. That could be catastrophizing because he's taking a relatively minor issue (not mentioning an ex from years ago) and escalating it to a major trust issue. He's assuming the worst-case scenario, like infidelity or deceit, without evidence. His reaction is disproportionate, which fits the definition of catastrophizing.

Alternatively, maybe the wife is catastrophizing if she's thinking that this one incident will ruin their marriage forever. But in the given text, she's ignoring him now, but the main focus is on his reaction. The husband's outburst, especially the name-calling and trust issues, seems like he's overestimating the severity of the situation. He's probably imagining that her not telling him about Dan indicates a bigger problem, leading to his extreme emotional response. So yes, his behavior is an example of catastrophizing.
</think>

The scenario described involves the husband reacting strongly to the revelation that his wife had a past relationship with Dan, which she did not disclose. Catastrophizing refers to the cognitive distortion where an individual anticipates the worst possible outcome, often irrationally escalating a situation beyond its actual implications. In this case, the husband's reaction—immediately jumping to distrust, calling her names, and questioning the entire foundation of their relationship—suggests he is magnifying the significance of her omission. Instead of addressing the lack of communication calmly, he assumes severe consequences (e.g., a fundamental breach of trust) without evidence of wrongdoing beyond her not mentioning Dan. His disproportionate emotional response and leap to extreme conclusions align with catastrophizing, as he interprets a minor issue (with no indication of ongoing deceit) as a catastrophic threat to their marriage. The wife’s actions (ignoring him) do not clearly fit this pattern, as her behavior reflects conflict avoidance rather than an exaggerated anticipation of disaster. The primary instance of catastrophizing here is the husband’s reaction.

Catastrophizing,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The example provided does not illustrate the concept of Catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual exaggerates the severity of a situation, often imagining the worst possible outcome and dwelling on it.

Catastrophizing,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"The concept of catastrophizing refers to a cognitive distortion where a person anticipates the worst possible outcome of a situation, often magnifying the potential negative impact of an event beyond what is realistic. In the scenario you've described, it seems that the issue revolves around a disagreement over dietary restrictions and budgeting for a group event.

You expressed your concerns about the food items listed in the budget due to your allergies and dietary restrictions. When your friend H responded that you should just eat the other items available, you decided not to attend and requested a refund of your contribution. Your friends are upset because your decision affects their budget.

This situation does not appear to be an example of catastrophizing. Instead, it seems to be a straightforward disagreement about how to handle dietary restrictions and financial contributions for a group event. You are concerned about your health and well-being, which is a valid concern, and you are not predicting an overly negative outcome; rather, you are making a decision based on your dietary needs.

In summary, your concern is about your health and the practical aspects of attending an event where you cannot eat most of the food provided, not about imagining the worst possible outcome of the situation. Therefore, this does not seem to be an instance of catastrophizing.

I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with.

After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"The example provided does not directly illustrate the concept of catastrophizing.

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her.

Catastrophizing,Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0," ANSWER: Yes

The situation you've described is a classic example of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). This cognitive bias causes individuals to attribute others' behaviors to internal, stable, and global dispositions, while underestimating the influence of situational factors.

In this case, your boyfriend is attributing Rachel Zegler's behavior to her personality traits, such as being full of herself, smug, and disrespectful, rather than considering the possibility that his discomfort might stem from her confidence, political views, and expressiveness, which he may find threatening or challenging.

Furthermore, when you challenge his perspective, he projects his discomfort onto you by suggesting that your defense of Zegler is driven by your feminist beliefs, rather than acknowledging that you might genuinely appreciate her qualities. This is another manifestation of the FAE, as he attributes your behavior to an external factor (your feminism) rather than considering the possibility that you might genuinely support Zegler as a person.

Lastly, his statement about feminism being unappealing if it's not ""cute and likable for dudes"" demonstrates a lack of understanding of the movement and its goals, which are about equality and justice for all, rather than catering to men's preferences. This further illustrates the Fundamental Attribution Error, as he attributes the nature of feminism to external factors (men's preferences) rather than recognizing its inherent values and goals.

In summary, your boyfriend's behavior in this situation is a clear example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as he attributes others' behaviors to their personal traits rather than considering situational factors or the broader context.",,yes,

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

The example you provided is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. This psychological phenomenon occurs when individuals make assumptions about another person's character or disposition based on a single observation or behavior, rather than considering the situation or context in which the behavior occurred.

In this case, you lied about purchasing a new couch, and people around you made assumptions about your character based on this single act. They attributed your lie to your personality traits, such as being manipulative or dishonest, rather than considering the possible reasons behind your actions, such as a desire to fit in or feel more successful. This is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as people are attributing your behavior to your internal traits rather than external factors.",,no,

My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

The exchange you described is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). FAE is a cognitive bias that occurs when people tend to explain others' actions based on their personality traits rather than situational factors. In this case, your father attributed your suggestion of a lakehouse or Airbnb to your laziness and fatness, rather than considering that you might have been suggesting it because you wanted a more relaxed and self-catered vacation, or because you thought it would be more enjoyable for your family. He also attributed your wife's work schedule and the state of your house to laziness, without considering the demands of work and childcare. This is an example of FAE because your father is attributing your actions to internal, stable traits (laziness and fatness) rather than external, unstable factors (the situation and demands of your life).",,no,
Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

The Fundamental Attribution Error occurs when individuals make an inaccurate assumption about the internal characteristics (such as personality traits, motives, or dispositions) of another person, rather than considering the external factors (such as the situation or context) that may have influenced the person's behavior.

In this example, the Rude Lady attributes the other person's behavior (taking her cart) to her internal characteristics (being disrespectful, lacking manners, or being a member of the ""younger generation"") rather than considering external factors, such as the fact that the other person was already using the cart and had their belongings in it. The Rude Lady's assumption is based on her own biases and preconceived notions, rather than an objective evaluation of the situation. This is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error.",,yes,
Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0," ANSWER: Yes

This situation appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). The FAE is a cognitive bias that involves attributing other people's actions to their internal traits, rather than external circumstances. In this case, you are attributing your friend's decision to pursue singing full-time to his inherent talent and passion, rather than considering the external factors such as his family's artistic background, his long-standing passion for singing, and the support he receives from his family and friends.

Additionally, you seem to be underestimating the role of effort and practice in improving one's skills, as you believe that your friend's singing and songwriting abilities are fixed and that he is unlikely to improve with more practice. This is another manifestation of the FAE, as you are attributing his current lack of success to his inherent talent, rather than considering the possibility that he may need more time and effort to develop his skills.

Furthermore, you seem to be attributing your friend's decision to pursue singing full-time to his lack of judgment and inability to make rational decisions, rather than considering the possibility that he may have carefully weighed the pros and cons of his decision and made a conscious choice based on his values and priorities. This is another example of the FAE, as you are attributing his decision to internal traits rather than external circumstances.

Overall, it is important to recognize the role of the FAE in our thinking and to strive to attribute other people's actions to a combination of internal traits and external circumstances. In this case, it may be helpful to consider the possibility that your friend has carefully considered his decision to pursue singing full-time and that he may have a realistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. It may also be helpful to offer support and encouragement, rather than trying to dissuade him from pursuing his dream.",,no,
Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The situation described in the example appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). FAE is a cognitive bias that involves attributing other people's behavior to their internal traits (e.g., personality, disposition) rather than external factors (e.g., situation, context).

In this case, the parents (F18's) attributed their behavior during the wedding reception to the daughter's character (e.g., being ungrateful, spoiled) rather than considering the context and the potential impact of their actions on others (e.g., the wedding, the guests, the daughter's feelings). They assumed that their daughter wanted a big celebration on her birthday, even though she had previously agreed to postpone it due to the wedding and the limited budget of the cousin.

Moreover, the parents seemed to disregard the daughter's feelings and preferences during the wedding reception, which further demonstrates the Fundamental Attribution Error. They prioritized their own desire to celebrate their daughter's birthday over the importance of the wedding and the comfort of their daughter and the guests.

In conclusion, the parents' behavior in this situation is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as they attributed the daughter's negative reaction to their actions to her character rather than considering the context and the potential impact of their behavior on others.",,no,
Fundamental Attribution Error,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0," ANSWER: Yes

The scenario you've described is an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error. This cognitive bias occurs when an individual attributes the behavior of others to internal, dispositional factors (e.g., personality, traits, attitudes) rather than external, situational factors. In this case, you have attributed your girlfriend's friendships to her low self-esteem, assuming that she intentionally seeks out friends with struggles to make herself feel better. This is an example of over-attributing the role of internal factors in shaping her behavior, ignoring the possibility that external factors (e.g., shared interests, common experiences, or social circumstances) might play a more significant role in her friendships.

By making this assumption, you have overlooked the complexity of human relationships and the various factors that influence them. It's essential to remember that people are not one-dimensional, and their friendships and relationships are not solely determined by their self-esteem. Instead, it's crucial to have open and honest communication with your girlfriend to understand her perspective and experiences better. This will help you develop a more accurate understanding of her friendships and avoid making assumptions based on the Fundamental Attribution Error.",,yes,

The situation you described appears to be an instance of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE). FAE is a cognitive bias that occurs when we attribute another person's behavior to their internal traits (e.g., personality, character) rather than external factors (e.g., situation, context).

In this case, your father's reaction to the few drops of water on the floor can be seen as an example of FAE. He attributed your behavior (wearing wet shoes) to a negative internal trait (disgusting, dirty) without considering the context or external factors (it was just a few drops of water, and you were about to join your family for dinner).

Additionally, your father's comments to your boyfriend about your alleged dirty habits can be seen as a further example of FAE, as he attributed your behavior to a persistent internal trait without considering that it might have been a one-time occurrence or an isolated incident.

It's important to note that while FAE is a common cognitive bias, it's not necessarily a fair or accurate way to judge others. It's always a good idea to consider all the relevant factors before making judgments about someone's behavior.

In this situation, it seems like you were caught off guard by your father's harsh reaction and didn't know how to respond. It's understandable that you felt upset and decided to leave the situation. However, it might be helpful to communicate with your family about their reactions and try to find a way to address any misunderstandings or miscommunications in the future.",,yes,
Fundamental Attribution Error,o3-mini,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

In the example provided, the boyfriend launches into a tirade about Rachel Zegler based on a series of personality-related judgments (e.g., “annoying facial expressions,” “full of herself,” “too smug”) and a dismissive view of her opinions. His focus is squarely on what he perceives as inherent traits in her—rather than considering any situational influences (like how the environment, social pressures, or the context of art/cinema might shape someone’s expression or beliefs).

Even though his rant is fueled by sexism and other prejudices, the way he explains his dislike is a textbook case of a dispositional attribution. Instead of, say, acknowledging that the context (public expectations, media portrayals, or even the performative aspects of her role) might shape her demeanor or choices, he reduces her to a set of fixed personality flaws. That discounting of external or situational factors in favor of an internal, character-based explanation is precisely what the Fundamental Attribution Error describes.

Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"Fundamental Attribution Error is the tendency to attribute someone else’s behavior predominantly to their personality or character while underestimating situational factors that might have influenced them. In the example you provided, what unfolds is a chain of dishonesty about buying a couch and the subsequent social fallout. Although people eventually judge the narrator harshly—as a defining trait (e.g., “fragile” or “fake”)—this situation isn’t a clear instance of the fundamental attribution error.

Here's why: The core of Fundamental Attribution Error involves observers (or us, when judging others) attributing actions to enduring personality traits rather than to external or situational factors. In this example, while some friends do label the narrator using personality-based criticisms (like “manipulative” or “fake”), the narrative mainly centers on the narrator’s own reflections on the lie and its consequences. The example is more about the results of having told a lie and the escalating social consequences, rather than a clear demonstration of attributing behavior solely to inherent character flaws while ignoring the context.

It could be argued that if the friends’ judgments were made entirely without considering external pressures (such as social anxiety or the desire to keep up appearances) and simply stamped the narrator as an inherently untrustworthy person, that might edge toward a fundamental attribution error. However, the description we have doesn’t delve deeply into how the friends reached their conclusions beyond their emotional responses to the lie. The focus isn’t on an observed bias in attributing behavior but on the unpleasant consequences of a series of dishonest acts, combined with the narrator’s internal struggles.

For this reason, the primary phenomenon at play in your example is not the observer’s cognitive bias in assessing others’ behavior (the very essence of the fundamental attribution error) but rather the self-inflicted social repercussions of lying and the psychological discomfort that comes from not living up to expected social norms.

Even when the daughter-in-law points out that external circumstances (like her work commitments and the realities of managing a toddler) significantly affect their choices, he remains fixed on blaming their character.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o3-mini,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

People are wild.",0,"Fundamental Attribution Error is the tendency to explain another person’s actions by attributing them to inherent characteristics (their personality, disposition, or “type”) rather than considering the external circumstances and context that might have influenced their behavior.

In this example, the narrator quickly labels the woman as “rude” and even uses terms such as “Karen-level tone” and comments on her “country club” style. These descriptions focus almost exclusively on her personal attributes instead of exploring the situational factors that might have led to her actions. For example, although she claims that she left the cart by the entrance to use while fetching coupons and even insists “I already touched it, and it has better wheels,” the narrator discounts these explanations, choosing instead to interpret her behavior in terms of her underlying character (rudeness or entitlement).

By emphasizing her personality traits and generalizing her behavior to a broader pattern (“the decline of respect in younger generations”), the narrator falls into the classic pattern of the fundamental attribution error—attributing the action to who she is rather than why the situation might have led her to act that way.

Thus, this example can indeed be seen as an instance of the fundamental attribution error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o3-mini,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is the tendency to overemphasize personal characteristics (or internal dispositions) as explanations for someone’s behavior while underestimating situational or external factors. In a classical FAE instance, one might judge someone’s actions entirely by their “character” and ignore the context or external influences that contributed.

In this example, the story centers on a man who has decided to pursue singing full time despite lacking demonstrable success in that area so far. The friend’s view is that he is “terrible” at singing and songwriting—an assessment based on his performance—and that his continued pursuit is a mistake. While this evaluation highlights an internal quality (his “lack of talent”), the narrative also includes rich context regarding his background: he comes from a family that is artistically inclined and was supported in his interests over the years; he was bullied for singing as a child, and he has persisted due to long-held passions and possibly motivational circumstances.

The friend’s concern seems to be based on the objective observation (in her view) of his ability, rather than an overly simplistic dismissal of situational factors. Although she harshly judges his talent, she also notes that his family’s support and his longstanding passion have helped shape his decisions. The discussion among their friends about whether to intervene also shows awareness of his social context. They even cite his family’s support as a likely reason why he might be unreceptive to criticism.

Thus, rather than being a clear-cut case of Fundamental Attribution Error—where one would entirely blame an internal trait while ignoring any situational influences—this example includes both personal evaluations (his singing ability) and context (family background, past experiences). The friend isn’t ignoring external factors; she’s aware of them, even if her evaluation of his musical ability is strongly negative.

Therefore, while the friend’s assessment is harsh, it is not a pure instance of FAE because the narrative does incorporate significant situational context and does not simply reduce his decision to an internal character flaw.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o3-mini,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) is the tendency to over‐attribute other people’s actions to their personal traits while underestimating the influence of situational factors. In the example provided, the narrator explains how the unusual timing and public nature of the birthday celebrations created an awkward, embarrassing situation. The parents, however, focus on the narrator’s reaction and label him as “ungrateful,” suggesting that his negative response is due to his character (being a “spoiled brat”) rather than recognizing that the circumstances—the overlap of events and the unexpected public celebration—played a significant role in how the situation felt to him.

In this case, the parents are not considering the situational awkwardness or the potential discomfort of having a birthday celebrated in the middle of a cousin’s wedding. Instead, they quickly attribute the reaction to the narrator’s personality. This tendency to discount the external pressures (i.e., the timing conflict and the nature of the event) and assume an internal, character-based cause in explaining the emotional reaction fits with the idea of Fundamental Attribution Error.

Thus, the way the parents explain the narrator’s reaction is an instance of making a fundamental attribution error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o3-mini,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0,"Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when someone attributes another person’s behavior to their internal traits (such as personality or character) rather than considering external, situational factors. In this example, the narrator sees his girlfriend’s choice in friends and immediately concludes that she must have low self esteem—a dispositional characteristic—rather than exploring other possible explanations (such as shared experiences, common challenges, or other situational factors that might influence her friendships).

Here, he overlooks the possibility that her friend group might be influenced by many external or circumstantial factors (like the nature of her social circle, opportunities to meet people in a particular context, etc.), and he instead infers an internal flaw (low self esteem). This pattern of hastily attributing her actions or choices to an inherent personal quality, while discounting alternative situational factors, is a classic instance of the fundamental attribution error.

My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?

",0,"The fundamental attribution error involves attributing someone’s behavior to their character or disposition while underestimating the influence of situational factors. In your story, your father observes a minor incident—wet shoes leaving a few water drops on the floor—and immediately labels you as “disgusting” and “dirty,” implying that this one small, likely unintentional occurrence reflects your inherent character. He seems to ignore other situational explanations (for example, you simply coming downstairs with wet shoes after a shower) and instead makes a sweeping judgment about who you are.

This pattern of behavior reflects a classic instance of the fundamental attribution error. By focusing on what he perceives as your inherent traits, rather than understanding the situational context (i.e., the wet shoes caused by a normal activity such as showering), he makes an overgeneralization about your character. His reaction is less about the actual situation at hand and more about an assumption regarding your overall nature.

Therefore, this example does illustrate the fundamental attribution error in the way your father evaluated your actions.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

By focusing primarily on these personal attributes to explain Rachel Zegler's behavior, the boyfriend is demonstrating the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o1-mini,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The situation you've described involves others interpreting your behavior—specifically, your decision to fabricate a story about purchasing a new couch—as a reflection of your character. This aligns with the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE), which is the tendency for people to overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors when judging others' behavior.

In your case, observers are attributing your actions to internal qualities such as being deceitful or superficial, rather than considering external pressures or insecurities that might have led you to lie.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o1-mini,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

I just feel sick about it and I can't make myself think straight.",0,"The **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)** refers to the tendency for individuals to overemphasize personal characteristics (dispositions) and underestimate situational factors when explaining others' behaviors. In other words, people often attribute others' actions to their inherent traits rather than considering the broader context or external circumstances that might influence those actions.

**Analyzing the Example:**

1. **Contextual Factors:**
   - The user is trying to organize a family vacation after almost a decade.
   - The user's spouse works six days a week and manages overnight shifts.
   - The family has a toddler, which adds to the household responsibilities.
   - The user is actively working to improve themselves and is managing a traumatic brain injury (TBI).

2. **Father's Attributions:**
   - **Dispositional Attributions:**
     - Labels the user and their spouse as ""fat"" and ""lazy.""
     - Criticizes the cleanliness of the user's house, attributing it to laziness.
   - **Lack of Situational Consideration:**
     - Ignores the demanding work schedules of the user and spouse.
     - Overlooks the added responsibilities of having a toddler.
     - Doesn't acknowledge the challenges posed by the user's TBI.

3. **Assessment:**
   - The father's criticism focuses solely on perceived personal shortcomings (""fat,"" ""lazy"") without acknowledging the situational pressures and efforts the user is making.
   - By attributing the state of the household and the decision-making about the vacation solely to the user's character, the father exemplifies the Fundamental Attribution Error.

**Conclusion:**
The father's response in the provided scenario primarily reflects dispositional attributions about the user’s behavior, neglecting the situational factors that contribute to those behaviors. This aligns with the definition and characteristics of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) involves overemphasizing personal characteristics and underestimating situational factors when explaining others' behaviors. In your scenario, the conflict arises from how you perceive your parents' actions in the context of your birthday coinciding with your cousin's wedding.

Your feelings of humiliation and disappointment are valid responses to the situation where your parents chose to spotlight your birthday during a significant family event. However, labeling this as an instance of FAE would imply that either you or your parents are misattributing motives based on personality rather than circumstances. In reality, your parents likely acted out of a desire to celebrate your milestone birthday within the constraints of the wedding day, considering factors like budgeting and venue availability.

The tension and misunderstanding seem to stem more from differing expectations and communication gaps rather than a misattribution of personal traits or dispositions. Therefore, while the situation is emotionally charged and complex, it doesn't neatly fit the definition of the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Fundamental Attribution Error,o1-mini,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",0,"The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) refers to the tendency to attribute others' behaviors to their inherent personality traits while underestimating the influence of situational factors. In the scenario provided, the boyfriend observes that his girlfriend's friends include individuals with disabilities or challenges and concludes that she might have low self-esteem, suggesting that she forms relationships with people who are ""worse off"" to boost her own self-image. This interpretation primarily attributes her behavior to her internal characteristics (low self-esteem) without fully considering external factors that might influence her choice of friends, such as shared interests, compassion, or meaningful connections beyond what the boyfriend perceives.

By making an assumption about her self-esteem based solely on the nature of her friends, the boyfriend exhibits the FAE by focusing on an internal explanation rather than exploring potential situational reasons for her social circle.

My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left.

",0,"The **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)** refers to the tendency of individuals to overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors when judging others' behavior. In the provided scenario, your father notices that your shoes are a bit wet—a minor and likely situational detail. Instead of considering that your shoes might have been wet due to harmless reasons (like a spill or unexpected weather), he attributes your wet shoes to a negative trait, calling you ""disgusting"" and a ""dirty person.""

Here's how this aligns with FAE:

1. **Situational Factor Ignored:** The wet shoes could be due to various benign reasons that are out of your control or simply an accident.
2. **Dispositional Attribution:** Your father immediately links the wet shoes to your character, labeling you negatively without considering external factors.
3. **Overgeneralization:** From a minor incident, he makes a sweeping judgment about your character and even extends it to future predictions about your relationship.

By focusing solely on the observable behavior (wet shoes) and ignoring the possible situational explanations, your father exemplifies the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Black and White Thinking,o3-mini,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"The example does show elements of black-and-white thinking. Black-and-white thinking, or dichotomous thinking, is a cognitive distortion where situations are viewed in extremes—either completely right or completely wrong, with no middle ground. In this instance, the mother’s reaction to the Facebook post represents an either/or mindset: if the daughter hadn’t made a Facebook post praising her on Mother’s Day, then the daughter must not truly care about her at all. This rigid, extreme perspective ignores the many nuances and other loving gestures that took place throughout the day.

Similarly, the daughter’s reaction—framing the day’s efforts as being completely devalued by the lack of a Facebook post—demonstrates a similar kind of all-or-nothing thinking. Both parties are caught up in a mindset where one small aspect (a social media post) becomes the sole barometer for the entire relationship or the totality of affection between them, rather than recognizing the complexity of their interactions and caregiving over time.

While there are many layers to their interaction and history, this specific exchange shows how, in the heat of the moment, both mother and daughter resort to extreme judgments rather than discussing the situation in a more balanced and nuanced way.

Black and White Thinking,o3-mini,"Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.

His father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"Black-and-white thinking (also known as dichotomous thinking) is the tendency to see situations, people, or behaviors in only extreme terms—good or bad, competent or incompetent—without acknowledging any gray area or nuance in between. In the example provided, the husband repeatedly labels the wife as ""incompetent"" for isolated mistakes rather than considering context, external factors (like the stress and grief from recent losses), or her overall performance and contributions. His language does not allow for the possibility that everyone can have lapses or make slips, especially under stress. 

Furthermore, when something goes wrong—whether it’s forgetting a phone number or a minor issue with a car—the husband immediately ties these incidents to an overall assessment of the wife’s competence. This rigid evaluation exemplifies black-and-white thinking because it reduces her behavior to one extreme (incompetence), ignoring the many areas where she is effective (e.g., taking on most household responsibilities, managing a demanding job, and being entrusted with mentoring duties).

In summary, the husband’s use of absolute terms, his dismissal of any nuance regarding her abilities or circumstances, and his unwillingness to view her in a more balanced light are all indicative of black-and-white thinking.

In this example, the narrator does compare two forms of expression—a genuine, human “messiness” filled with personality versus a polished, AI-generated note—and seems to imply that the human effort, even if imperfect, holds more emotional value. However, the narrator also acknowledges the good intentions behind using AI (""I feel like the reason he used it was to try and make me happy"") and expresses conflicting feelings about the experience. Their internal conflict shows a recognition of both the value of the effort and the disappointment of lacking personal authenticity, rather than simply categorizing the situation as wholly one way or the other.

This blend of acknowledgment for the partner’s attempt to please while also mourning the loss of a truly personal touch displays nuance. Because the narrator is grappling with mixed feelings and appreciates multiple facets of the situation, it isn’t a clear-cut instance of black-and-white thinking.

Black and White Thinking,o3-mini,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.
",0,"The post shows a tendency to see things in an overly dichotomous way. The writer clearly distinguishes between two categories of gift-giving: one that involves a lot of thought, care, and even handmade or unique items, and another that’s seen as utterly lacking effort—a mere token gesture appropriate only for more impersonal occasions like an office party. This binary view overlooks any nuance regarding why someone might choose a simpler gift. For instance, there could be many reasons behind the selection of a Starbucks gift card or a hot chocolate basket that aren’t necessarily reflective of a lack of care or thoughtfulness. The perception here is that if a gift isn’t elaborate enough according to the writer’s personal standards, it automatically equates to disrespect or ridicule.

This sort of all-or-nothing judgment is a textbook example of black and white thinking. Instead of acknowledging a spectrum of possibilities and motivations behind gift choices, the writer opts for an extreme evaluation where gifts fall into two clear-cut and mutually exclusive categories. He doesn’t seem to entertain the idea that a person might have a different yet genuine way of expressing care or that circumstances might influence what gift they can give.

In summary, the post exemplifies black and white thinking by categorizing gifts into just two types—high-effort versus low-effort—with no room for any middle ground or alternative interpretations.

Black and White Thinking,o3-mini,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"Black and white thinking is a cognitive distortion where things are seen in only extreme terms, with no middle ground. It involves judging situations, people, or objects as either completely good or completely bad with no nuance.

In the scenario described, the individual places very high value on the sentimental object by remembering its pristine, original state—a cherished reminder of a special past. When the teddy bear is damaged (dirty, stained, and “not the same anymore”), the response is as if the object has lost all of its positive value, rather than acknowledging that it might still hold sentimental worth despite its imperfections. The idea that “if it isn’t perfect, then it’s ruined” is a form of dichotomous thinking. The emotional reaction is based on viewing the object in an all-or-nothing way—either it is exactly as it once was, or it has become entirely unacceptable.

Thus, by insisting on a binary evaluation of the teddy bear’s worth (pristine vs. ruined) without room for any middle ground, the example does exhibit characteristics of black and white thinking.

Black and White Thinking,o3-mini,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

Thing is.. it doesn’t cross my mind to ask right away but i’ll eventually ask maybe that night after kids go to sleep.

I told her that i’d try harder but that it’s hard for me to program myself to remember to ask as soon as she gets home. She told me that I shouldn’t have to try and that it’s “normal” to just ask. She feels like I’m inconsiderate.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"In this example there is an element of rigidity in expectation. The wife seems to hold an “all-or-nothing” standard: either the husband asks about her special outing immediately upon her arrival, or he is seen as inconsiderate. By viewing the situation in these extremes, she leaves little room for nuance or individual differences in behavior (in this case, his natural way of processing or “programming” his own responses).

Black and white (or dichotomous) thinking is a cognitive pattern in which people categorize events, behaviors, or people into one of two categories with no gray area in between. Here the wife’s expectation—that asking immediately is not only desirable but the only acceptable way to show care—can be seen as a kind of black-and-white stance. If her husband does not act in that very specific moment, her conclusion is that he is inconsiderate, without entertaining the possibility that the caring intent might simply be expressed on a slightly different timeline (such as later that evening).

That said, the scenario might also simply be a difference in habits and communication styles. However, if she strictly adheres to the notion that “if it’s not immediate, then it’s inconsiderate” with no room for context or flexibility, it does align with the pattern of black and white thinking.

Black and White Thinking,o3-mini,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"Black and White Thinking involves viewing situations, behaviors, or people in extremes—for example, labeling an entire experience as entirely negative because of one problematic occurrence—and typically uses words like ""always,"" ""never,"" or ""completely."" In the provided narrative, the girlfriend states after the incident that her boyfriend ""always has to find a way to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks."" This sweeping generalization overlooks the complexities of their relationship and the specific context of that night. Rather than considering that this might have been an isolated or context-dependent incident, she moves to a more black-and-white evaluation of his behavior on dates in general.

This particular expression demonstrates black and white thinking because it reduces the boyfriend's behavior to a pattern of ""always ruining things"" without acknowledging any positive qualities or the multifaceted nature of his reactions. Instead of recognizing that the stressful situation might have provoked an extreme response, and that there could be nuances or maybe even valid feelings on his part, it all gets labeled in an all-encompassing, negative way.

I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",0,"Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, involves perceiving situations, people, or events in extremes without recognizing the middle ground or nuances. In the context you've provided, several elements suggest that this cognitive distortion might be at play:

1. **Use of Absolutes:** Your husband frequently labels situations or actions using absolute terms like ""incompetent"" and expresses frustration in a blunt, harsh manner. This suggests a tendency to categorize events or behaviors in starkly negative terms without room for understanding or appreciation of complexities.

2. **Lack of Nuance:** Despite acknowledging your responsibilities and successes—such as managing household tasks, excelling in your job, and mentoring others—his focus remains on specific instances where he perceives you as making mistakes. This selective attention to negatives over positives is characteristic of Black and White Thinking.

3. **Impact of Stress and Grief:** While he attributes his harshness to stress and grief, the persistent use of derogatory language indicates a possible pattern rather than a temporary reaction. This reinforces the binary perception of situations and individuals.

4. **External Feedback:** Others have noticed and commented on his harsh communication, suggesting that his perspective might be skewed towards extremes that overshadow a more balanced view of your relationship and individual capabilities.

5. **Self-Reflection:** Your own acknowledgment of moments where you may act ""a bit of an airhead and ditzy"" shows self-awareness, contrasting with his inability to see beyond specific errors to your overall competence and contributions.

Given these points, it appears that the dynamics described align with the characteristics of Black and White Thinking, particularly in the way your husband evaluates and communicates about circumstances and your abilities.

Black and White Thinking,o1-mini,"So my partner has always struggled with words and don’t have a way with words. He’s always said he admired my way with words. I studied literature and poetry. I’ve always tried to introduce him to the literature and poetry and tried to find ones I thought he would like. He still struggles but I never mind, I have only showed him those things for his enjoyment not to change him. To me they way is speaks is simply how she speaks. Recently he has discovered chat GBT and uses it to help with some things that need to sound more put together like resumes or letters to a boss (I used to help him with these). However yesterday when I got my birthday card I could tell most of it was ai generated. There was only one bit at the end that included a line that we say to each other that I knew was him. I don’t know how to feel. I’m sad that the card didn’t feel genuine or real. I felt like there was no effort into me. I wouldn’t have minded if it was completely all over the place with no proper grammar if it was from the heart. But it was a long heartfelt whole card long thing that I know was from chat GBT. He wasn’t home to see me open the card and I’m relieved because he was so excited for me to read it and now I feel like it’s because he was hoping I would think he improved but my face would have said it all. AIO. I feel like the reason he used it was to try and make me happy and maybe I should take that and appreciate it at the same time I would’ve preferred something that came from him.",0,"Black and White Thinking, or All-or-Nothing Thinking, involves perceiving situations in extreme, absolute terms without recognizing the nuances or middle grounds. In the provided example, the individual expresses disappointment that the majority of the birthday card was AI-generated, feeling it lacked genuineness and personal effort. However, they also acknowledge that the partner's use of AI might have been an attempt to make them happy and recognizes the presence of a personal touch in the final line.

This reflection shows a mix of emotions and an understanding that the situation isn't entirely one-sided. The individual doesn't completely dismiss the gesture but grapples with the balance between authenticity and effort.

Black and White Thinking,o1-mini,"I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.
",0,"Yes, the example provided illustrates Black and White Thinking. This cognitive distortion is characterized by viewing situations, people, or events in extreme, all-or-nothing terms without recognizing any middle ground or nuances.

In the scenario, the individual places high value on giving thoughtful, handmade gifts, emphasizing the time and effort invested. When receiving gifts that are more generic, like Starbucks gift cards and hot chocolate gift baskets, he interprets them as a complete lack of effort and considers them inferior. This binary perspective dismisses the possibility that his family members may have different constraints, preferences, or intentions behind their gift choices. Instead of acknowledging that the gifts, while different, still hold value, he categorizes them as entirely inadequate. This all-or-nothing thinking leads to feelings of being undervalued and frustrated, without considering any positive aspects or alternative explanations for the choice of gifts.

Black and White Thinking,o1-mini,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"Black and White Thinking refers to a cognitive distortion where individuals perceive situations, people, or events in absolute terms—either all good or all bad—without acknowledging the nuances or middle ground. This type of thinking often overlooks the complexities of a situation and can lead to misunderstandings or heightened emotional reactions.

In the provided example, the individual is deeply upset about her mother throwing away her sentimental teddy bear. While her reaction is intense, it doesn't necessarily exemplify Black and White Thinking. Instead, it highlights a strong emotional attachment to a cherished object and the hurt caused by its disposal. She acknowledges that the bear was a significant part of her past and understands her parents' perspective to some extent, even if she disagrees with their action. Her struggle revolves more around emotional expression and managing differing viewpoints within her family rather than categorizing actions or people in absolutes.

Black and White Thinking,o1-mini,"So, my wife has this thing when she gets home from something special for example, a girls night out or a special occasion, and she wants me to ask her how it went as soon as she gets home.

I told her that i’d try harder but that it’s hard for me to program myself to remember to ask as soon as she gets home. She told me that I shouldn’t have to try and that it’s “normal” to just ask. She feels like I’m inconsiderate.

I don’t get it… any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?

UPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",0,"Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, involves perceiving situations in extreme, absolute terms without recognizing the middle ground or nuances. In the scenario you've described, your wife expects you to ask about her day immediately upon her return, viewing it as a ""normal"" and necessary gesture. While her expectation is clear and strong, it doesn't necessarily reflect Black and White Thinking. Instead, it highlights a specific communication preference within your relationship.

Your wife's reaction may stem from a desire for immediate connection and acknowledgment after her experiences, rather than viewing the situation in absolute terms of right or wrong. Additionally, you both acknowledge the effort and communicate openly about the issue, indicating a willingness to find a middle ground rather than seeing things in extremes.

Therefore, this example does not exemplify Black and White Thinking but rather showcases a common communication discrepancy that can be addressed through mutual understanding and compromise.

Black and White Thinking,o1-mini,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"Black and White Thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, involves viewing situations, people, or outcomes in extreme, absolute terms without acknowledging the nuances or middle ground. In the provided example, several elements suggest the presence of Black and White Thinking:

1. **Generalizations and Absolutes**: The individual states, ""he always has to find a way to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks."" This is a sweeping generalization, implying that the boyfriend invariably reacts negatively in all situations, which is characteristic of Black and White Thinking.

2. **Extreme Emotional Responses**: The boyfriend's reaction to a relatively minor issue (difficulty parking) escalates to throwing items, slamming brakes, and locking the door. Such extreme responses can indicate a tendency to perceive situations in extremes rather than seeing a spectrum of possible reactions.

3. **Lack of Middle Ground**: Both parties seem to adopt a stance where there's no compromise or understanding. The boyfriend refuses assistance outright, and the individual labels his behavior as ruining the entire evening, leaving little room for nuanced perspectives or acknowledgments of each other's feelings.

4. **Self-Defeating Narratives**: The boyfriend claims that her speaking to him exacerbated the situation, placing all the blame on her actions without considering his own role in escalating the conflict.

While the situation involves clear misunderstandings and emotional reactions, the use of absolute terms and the absence of balanced viewpoints align with the characteristics of Black and White Thinking.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

",0,"The sunk cost fallacy is the tendency to continue a course of action because you’ve already invested resources (such as time, money, or effort), even if that course isn’t leading to a positive outcome. In many cases, someone might argue, “I’ve put so much into this already, I can’t abandon it now,” which can keep them stuck in a situation that no longer benefits them.

In the example, the person explains that despite numerous issues with her husband and the household responsibilities that overwhelmingly fall on her, she has “gone back and forth” about whether to leave. Her hesitation about leaving is not based on an objective evaluation of current benefits versus future possibilities but rather on a fear of the unknown that comes with leaving a long-term commitment. Implicitly, her reference to how long the relationship has lasted – spending six years together with four years of marriage – suggests that she may be holding on partly because of the time already invested, even though the situation is no longer working for her.

This is a classic hallmark of the sunk cost fallacy: remaining in a decision or relationship simply because of the “sunk” investments (time, money, emotional energy) that have already been made, rather than assessing whether the current path is the best one moving forward. Even though a rational look would show that continuing in an unfulfilling, one-sided relationship is likely to have negative consequences, the weight of past time and effort makes it hard for her to break out of this cycle.

Thus, because her reluctance to leave seems influenced by not wanting her previous years together to “go to waste” and her fear of starting over (the unknown), this example does illustrate an instance of the sunk cost fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The sunk cost fallacy happens when someone continues an endeavor or remains committed to a decision based solely on the resources (time, money, effort) they’ve already invested, even when new evidence suggests that the cost outweighs the benefits. In the example provided, the situation is a relationship conversation where the boyfriend is expressing anger and prejudice against a celebrity based on his own reasons. There isn’t an element in which someone is “throwing good money after bad” or refusing to change course simply because of past investments.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"The sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues a course of action just because they have already invested time, money, or effort—even if the current benefits no longer justify that decision. In this example, the writer expresses that “it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much.” This phrase reveals the idea that previous investments (the deposits, preparations, contracts, etc.) are driving the decision to stick with the wedding plans, despite potential issues (like the lack of proper facilities and the sound system problems) that might warrant rethinking the event.

A clear hallmark of the sunk cost fallacy is the temptation to let irrecoverable past expenditures (both emotional and financial) dictate current decisions, rather than evaluating the future costs and benefits independently. In the narrative, the focus on the investments already made is used as a reason to proceed, even though it might be more rational to consider whether continuing with the wedding as planned will actually deliver the best outcome for everyone involved.

Therefore, this example does demonstrate the sunk cost fallacy because it shows a decision (or an inclination to decide) that is being influenced by how much has already been invested, rather than solely by what might be best going forward.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"The sunk cost fallacy refers to the irrational behavior of continuing with a decision or endeavor because of the resources (time, money, effort) that have already been invested, even when the current circumstances would warrant a change in course. Essentially, it is when past investments—which cannot be recovered—influence ongoing commitment, even if that commitment might not be logically justified.

In this example, the wife is upset because she put significant effort into making a Tres Leches cake and other baked goods, yet her husband hasn’t taken any of it, even though it was made for their planned time together. Her frustration stems from feeling that her work isn’t appreciated and that her husband is not reciprocating or even trying the items she prepared.

However, this situation does not clearly demonstrate sunk cost behavior. The sunk cost fallacy would typically involve someone continuing to invest in or do something solely because of the resources already spent, irrespective of the current benefits or desire to continue. For instance, if the wife were insisting on serving or eating the cake just because she already made it, even though she doesn’t want to (or even if it were unpalatable now), that might lean toward sunk cost reasoning. Likewise, if the husband were forcing himself to eat the cake just to avoid ""wasting"" the effort, that could be an example. 

In this case, the husband simply isn’t interested in tasting the cake because he wasn’t hungry or had other preferences, and he is making a rational decision based on his current state. The wife’s disappointment arises from unmet expectations and feelings of being underappreciated rather than from an irrational insistence on continuing something due to sunk costs. There isn’t a clear instance where either party is making decisions solely to justify previous investments.

Therefore, this example isn’t an instance of the sunk cost fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes.

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias in which someone continues a course of action based primarily on the amount they've already invested—be it time, money, or effort—instead of reassessing their current best option. It’s when you “throw good money after bad” because you don’t want what you’ve already invested to go to waste, even though abandoning the endeavor would be the more rational decision.

In the example you provided, the husband initially agreed to do a quick 15‐minute favor. However, despite his clear work obligations and the increased inconvenience once the situation took longer than expected, he only decided to return to DT because his wife insisted and because it might have been socially or relationally necessary. His decision wasn’t driven by a deep-seated “I’ve already invested the time, so I must continue” mentality. Rather, it was more about trying to manage conflicting priorities: his need to work and his wife’s expectation.

There isn’t really evidence that he continued simply because he’d already invested time and energy. Instead, he was reluctant (knowing his work obligations were at stake) and communicated his needs. The pressure to stay came from his wife’s reaction, not from an internal, sunk-cost–based rationale.

Thus, this example doesn’t neatly fit the concept of the sunk cost fallacy. His behavior reflects a tension between responsibilities and relational dynamics rather than an irrational justification based solely on what he had already invested.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"The sunk cost fallacy is when someone persists with an endeavor or decision because they’ve already invested significant resources (time, money, effort) in it—even if continuing is not beneficial—simply because the cost is “sunk” and cannot be recovered. In this case, the person chose not to attend the event after discovering that the food items aren’t safe for their allergies, and they asked for their money back. This is a reasonable decision given that the arrangement changed in a crucial way for them, rather than sticking to the original plan solely because money was already spent.

On the other hand, the argument from H and her friends—that backing out and trying to recover the money will “damage their budget”—seems to imply that because the money has been gathered, the event should go on even if one person no longer benefits from it. This reasoning is closer to a sunk cost mindset, where the people involved are trying to force continuation because of the previously invested money, even though the original rationale (ensuring everyone’s dietary restrictions are respected) is now compromised.

However, the core decision you made (to withdraw and ask for a refund) is not an example of the sunk cost fallacy. You are not forcing yourself to continue solely because you’ve already put money into the plan. Instead, you’re acting on new information (that the event won’t suit your needs) and making a rational decision even if some of the money would now be “lost” to the overall budget if you continued. Thus, your decision is actually to avoid the sunk cost fallacy, not an instance of it.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o3-mini,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"The sunk cost fallacy occurs when someone continues an endeavor or decision because of the cumulative prior investment (time, money, effort), even if continuing is not the most rational choice. In the story you provided, the exchange between you and your cousin revolves around issues of pride, validation, and differing views on intelligence. There is a dispute about who is smarter, with her seeking validation and you objecting to outright praise. Despite the emotional intensity, the discussion is about personal reputation and comparison—it isn’t about making a decision or persisting in an action solely because of past investments.

In this case, neither you nor your cousin is justifying your actions by referring to already invested resources or by insisting on continuing a behavior simply because you have previously committed to it. The disagreement is rooted in assumptions about intelligence and self-esteem rather than any form of economic or rational decision-making that would justify irrational continuation due to previous costs. Hence, this scenario does not illustrate the sunk cost fallacy.

",0,"The sunk cost fallacy involves continuing a course of action mainly because of the resources (time, money, effort) already invested, even if that course is no longer in one’s best interest. It’s about letting past investments dictate current or future decisions.

In the scenario you described, the issues arise from emotional abuse and conflict between family members, rather than from a decision based on past investments. While you may wonder if you should have stayed in the situation or responded differently, those feelings are tied to the hurtful environment and manipulation rather than a calculation based on unrecoverable costs that would compel you to continue with something you otherwise would leave.

Thus, this situation isn’t an example of the sunk cost fallacy—it’s a situation that involves complex interpersonal dynamics and the impact of emotional abuse.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o1-mini,"My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

",0,"The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** occurs when individuals continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, effort) rather than evaluating the current and future benefits and costs. This cognitive bias can lead to irrational decision-making, where past investments unduly influence present choices, even when those past investments are no longer relevant or recoverable.

In the scenario you've described, several elements suggest that the Sunk Cost Fallacy may be at play:

1. **Length of Relationship:** Being together for six years and married for almost four years represents a significant investment of time and emotional energy. This long-term commitment can make it challenging to consider ending the relationship, even if it isn't fulfilling.

2. **Fear of the Unknown:** You mention being scared of leaving due to the uncertainty of what lies beyond the current situation. This fear can cause individuals to cling to the relationship, focusing on the time already spent rather than assessing whether staying is beneficial for your well-being.

3. **Continuous Investment:** Despite ongoing issues—such as unequal distribution of responsibilities, financial strain, lack of intimacy, and declining relationship satisfaction—you've remained in the marriage. The continual hope that things will change (""he says he will but it only lasts for a week"") indicates a persistent investment in the relationship's future, possibly overshadowing the present dissatisfaction.

4. **Emotional Attachment:** Emotional investments and the desire to maintain the relationship can make it difficult to objectively evaluate its viability. This attachment can lead to prioritizing the preservation of the relationship over personal happiness and fulfillment.

While it's natural to feel conflicted about leaving a long-term relationship, especially one with substantial shared history, it's essential to assess whether the decision to stay is based on the genuine hope for positive change or primarily on the desire to justify the time already invested. If the latter is true, it may indeed be an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o1-mini,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The scenario you've described revolves around a heated conversation between you and your boyfriend regarding Rachel Zegler and broader issues related to feminism and personal expressions. The crux of the interaction seems to center on your boyfriend's inability to accept confident and expressive women, projecting his discomfort onto Rachel Zegler's personality and by extension, onto you.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy Explained:**
The sunk cost fallacy occurs when an individual continues a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), rather than cutting their losses because the current costs outweigh the benefits.

**Analysis of the Scenario:**
In the situation you presented, there is no indication that either you or your boyfriend are continuing a course of action based on previously invested resources. Instead, the interaction appears to be more about differing opinions, expectations regarding feminism, and personal discomfort with certain traits. Your boyfriend is expressing his frustrations and attempting to influence your perception of Rachel Zegler, but this doesn't involve continuing an endeavor due to past investments.

There might be other cognitive biases at play, such as confirmation bias or projection, but the sunk cost fallacy doesn't seem to fit this context.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o1-mini,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

I feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he’s being reasonable.",0,"The situation you described revolves around the dynamics between you and your fiancé concerning your upcoming wedding. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when individuals continue with a decision based on the cumulative prior investments (time, money, effort) rather than the current and future benefits or drawbacks. 

In your case, you feel devastated at the idea of postponing the wedding because you believe that you've already invested so much into the plans, such as deposits, invitations, and arrangements. This feeling can be indicative of the sunk cost fallacy because it suggests a reluctance to change plans due to past investments, even if those investments cannot be recovered and may not serve the best interests moving forward.

Your fiancé, on the other hand, is expressing concerns about the quality of the wedding venue and is considering postponing to ensure the day meets both of your expectations. His approach appears to be focused on the future quality of the wedding rather than being influenced by past investments.

Therefore, the example primarily illustrates you grappling with the sunk cost fallacy—feeling that stopping now would mean all the previous investments were in vain—even though it might be more beneficial for both of you to prioritize the quality and success of the wedding over past expenditures.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o1-mini,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"The scenario you've described revolves around a situation where significant effort was invested in preparing a cake for guests who ultimately did not attend as expected. The disappointment arises from the husband's lack of appreciation and refusal to consume even a portion of the cake, despite its preparation and availability.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy Explained:**
The sunk cost fallacy occurs when individuals continue a behavior or endeavor solely because of the resources they have already invested (time, money, effort), rather than evaluating the current benefits or costs objectively. Essentially, it's the reluctance to abandon a project or decision because of previously invested resources, even when it's clear that continuing is not the best course of action.

**Application to the Scenario:**
In the situation you described, the focus is on the emotional fallout from the husband's lack of participation in enjoying the cake. There isn't an evident continuation of an action or decision based on past investments despite current disadvantages. Instead, it's a matter of unmet expectations and feelings of unappreciation. The husband isn't making a decision to continue something because of past investments; rather, he's simply not engaging with the outcome (the cake) despite having it available.

Therefore, this situation doesn't exemplify the sunk cost fallacy, as there is no behavior of continuing an endeavor solely due to past investments.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o1-mini,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

In the provided scenario, the individual initially agrees to take a brief 15-minute favor—moving his wife's car to Discount Tire. The situation unexpectedly escalates, leading to tension between him and his wife about staying longer than anticipated. The crux of the issue revolves around the desire to revert to work rather than being a direct example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Initial Commitment**: The individual voluntarily agrees to help, viewing it as a short task.
2. **Unexpected Extension**: The task takes longer due to unforeseen circumstances (tires needing attention).
3. **Decision Point**: Instead of feeling compelled to stay longer because of the time already invested, he attempts to leave to return to work, which indicates he is not succumbing to the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
4. **Conflict**: The wife's insistence on his continued presence is more about her expectations and perhaps emotional investment rather than rationalizing his continued effort based on prior investment.

In essence, the individual is trying to avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy by recognizing that the additional time spent doesn’t provide proportional benefits and is instead attempting to prioritize his work commitments.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"The scenario you've described revolves around interpersonal dynamics, self-perception, and the need for validation. The Sunk Cost Fallacy specifically pertains to the tendency to continue an endeavor or commitment because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even when it's no longer the best decision based on current circumstances.

In your example, the cousin's behavior—demanding validation of her intelligence and reacting negatively when it's not provided—is more about her need for acknowledgment and self-esteem issues rather than any decision influenced by past investments. There doesn't appear to be an element where past investments are causing her to persist in a particular stance or behavior against rational judgment.

Sunk Cost Fallacy,o1-mini,"I am 19 female and I have a boyfriend who comes every saturday night to have dinner with my family and me. My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?

",0,"The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** occurs when individuals continue a behavior or endeavor based on previously invested resources (such as time, money, or effort) rather than evaluating the current situation objectively. It's the idea of ""throwing good money after bad"" because of past commitments, even when it's no longer beneficial.

In the scenario you described, the situation revolves around a conflict with your father, his derogatory remarks, and the resulting emotional distress. Your decision to leave the situation and take care of your emotional well-being doesn't indicate a commitment based on past investments that would typify the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Instead, it reflects a response to an unhealthy and emotionally taxing environment. The consideration here is more about emotional health and boundary-setting rather than being influenced by previously invested resources that compel you to stay despite negative circumstances.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I’m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",0,"The IKEA Effect is the cognitive bias where people tend to overvalue products or outcomes that they have put significant effort into creating or assembling, even if the objective quality might be no higher (or even lower) than that of a professionally made alternative. In your example, you spent around 60 hours building a custom cabinet with an attic access door, surpassing basic requirements and adding personal touches like the functional mailbox lock. Because you invested so much personal effort and creativity into the design, you naturally value this work highly. When external parties—namely, the interior designer and the client—disapprove of a detail that you included for functional reasons, your frustration stems not only from the rework but also from the fact that your own labor and design choices have been dismissed.

This situation aligns well with the concept of the IKEA Effect. You are experiencing a form of cognitive bias where the effort and time you invested into this unique, self-made product have increased your personal valuation of the work. Thus, when others do not appreciate or recognize the value of your assembled work, it leads to a disproportionate sense of loss or frustration. 

Therefore, considering that the personal investment of time and creativity has led you to overvalue your project—and the subsequent negative emotional reaction when that value is not recognized—it is accurate to say that this is an instance of the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"I hate it when I’m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like “I wasn’t paying attention”. It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.
I love watching movies. I know it’s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it’s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it.

I’m not sure if there’s something I’m doing wrong but I don’t act that way when they talk about something I don’t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don’t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I’m saying as if it doesn’t matter. And like I said it’s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don’t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out.

This discussion centers on interpersonal communication, validation, and emotional connection rather than on valuing something because of one's own labor or creation.

There is no element in the example that relates to building or assembling something oneself, which is key to the IKEA Effect.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess.",0,"The IKEA effect refers to the phenomenon where people tend to overvalue things that they have had a hand in creating or assembling, even if the finished product isn’t objectively superior. In other words, when individuals invest personal effort into making something, they subsequently assign it an increased value that isn’t always justified by its intrinsic qualities.

In the example provided, the situation revolves around a wife who made a Tres Leches cake with considerable effort, only to have her husband never sample it despite multiple opportunities. The issue here is more about her feelings of hurt and disappointment that her work isn’t being appreciated or shared by her husband—not about a situation where someone values something more simply because they made it. In fact, if the IKEA effect were at work, one might expect the person who put in the effort (or someone who also contributed to the creation) to have an inflated sense of value for the outcome. However, in this situation it is the wife whose creation is being undervalued by someone else, not an instance where the creator is valuing the product more because she built it herself.

Therefore, this example does not illustrate the IKEA effect, but rather a different dynamic concerning expectations, appreciation, and communication between the couple.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"Genuine question because I don't know what normal is here. My gut tells me this is something parents should never do to their children. I don't know if that makes me moralizing or pretentious about my own parenting. Maybe I'm overreacting and being a lil bitch about it, but here's the context.

My family was trying to decide where to go on a vacation together because we haven't been on a big family vacation as a group in almost a decade. We were all suggesting various ideas, such as Florida, South Dakota, Canada, Georgia, etc. just trying to determine where to go. I said ""we could rent a lakehouse or an Airbnb somewhere by a beach.""

For some reason, this upset my dad and here's how it went:

""No I work TOO HARD to worry about BREAKFAST so I need SOMEONE ELSE to do it FOR ME. You only want to go somewhere not a hotel because you and your wife are TOO FAT AND LAZY.""

Me: ""why would you say that? Even if you thought it, you shouldn't say that.""

(Mom interjects here, tells my dad that was very rude)

Him: ""Because it's true and I'm just telling the truth.""

Me: ""Ok so my wife who works 6 days a week and overnights is lazy? We got 2 houses by being lazy? I'm not leaving my son on an iPad either.""

Him: ""YES I have seen your house and you aren't prioritizing keeping it clean! We had 3 kids and it was always clean!"" <This was my mom's insane hard work, not his>

Me: ""It's perfectly fine and normal for having a toddler in the house. Why are you going on about this? It's embarrassing and it makes me not want to go with you if you're going to act like this""

Past this point I was so furious and overwhelmed with all this plus getting a killer migraine from my TBI acting up again that I sorta blacked out and forgot what happened for a few minutes after. I just know that eventually things went back to awkward and ""normal"" for a bit.

He's always called me fat and lazy on occasion and this time just seemed to be the last straw. I'm not really that fat--I would like to lose 20 pounds sure--and I don't think I'm lazy given I'm working very hard at work, improving myself, and healing from my TBI.

Is this normal? What the heck do I do? I just feel sick about it and I can't make myself think straight.",0,"The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people tend to give greater value to things they have helped create or assemble—even if the end product isn’t perfect—simply because they invested effort into it. For example, if you spend time putting together furniture from a kit, you might end up feeling especially attached to it and value it more highly than a similar, pre-assembled item.

In the situation you described, the core interaction involves family planning for a vacation and personal criticisms regarding laziness and housekeeping. This is more about interpersonal conflict and resentment rather than overvaluing something due to one’s own contribution. Although there is mention of the choices between renting a lake house or hotel accommodations, there is no element of assembling or creating something where someone would later value it more because of their personal input. The discussion and emotional conflict center on personal habits and attitudes rather than a scenario in which effort leads to overvaluation.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The IKEA Effect describes the tendency for people to value items more highly when they have put effort into assembling or creating them, even if the final product isn’t objectively superior—or even if it’s flawed. It’s about the psychological bias in which we overvalue our own handiwork simply because we contributed to its creation.

In the example you provided, the sister makes handmade gifts (paintings) that are not well-received by you or your husband. Although she puts effort into creating these gifts and might personally value them more highly due to the time and energy invested, the focus of your commentary is on her repeated gifting of items you don't find appealing, rather than on you overvaluing something you assembled yourself. The phenomenon at work in your story is more about mismatched gift expectations and the awkward obligation to accept something that is not appreciated, rather than the IKEA Effect as it’s defined in psychological research.

Furthermore, the IKEA Effect would be at play if, for instance, you had built a piece of furniture yourself and then felt an inflated sense of attachment or satisfaction with it due to the effort you put into the assembly process—even if it wasn’t perfect. Here, however, the scenario is about the sister’s consistent choice to make gifts (and your resulting dissatisfaction), not about you or anyone else overvaluing your own work.

Thus, while the sister might personally feel that her handmade gifts are more special because she made them (which is loosely related to the spirit of the IKEA Effect), your issue is not about the valuation bias that the IKEA Effect explains. Instead, it revolves around gift preferences and the tension between her creative intentions and your expectations of receiving something more aligned with a typical, purchased gift that meets your needs or tastes.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"(Trow away since some people I know in RL know my account)

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?",0,"The IKEA Effect refers to a cognitive bias where people tend to overvalue things they have created or assembled themselves, regardless of the actual quality of the finished product. In other words, when you put effort into making something, you’re likely to think it’s better than a similar item produced by someone else.

In the case you described, the sister-in-law makes gifts herself, and she (and apparently her family) appreciates the thought and effort behind the DIY presents. However, this situation isn’t an example of the IKEA Effect in its true form. The effect usually involves the person who has participated in the creation (or assembly) placing higher value on that object. In your example, while your sister-in-law might attach extra significance to her own creations, you (the recipient) are not the one who made the items, and you don’t seem to be influenced by the extra effort that went into them. Instead, you simply have different tastes and preferences regarding the type of gifts you like.

Thus, while the story does touch on the idea that handcrafted items can be seen as meaningful by their makers (which is related to the broader idea behind the IKEA Effect), your situation isn’t a clear-cut demonstration of that cognitive bias affecting your own valuation of items you have a hand in creating. It’s more about a difference in taste and the way people derive value from thoughtfulness rather than a bias stemming from personal labor invested.

IKEA Effect,o3-mini,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

In this situation, however, no such self-creation or assembly is taking place; the individual is simply making a purchasing decision about a phone to gain autonomy and to avoid being tracked by their mother.

In the example provided, the general contractor invested significant time (60 hours) and effort into designing and building a custom cabinet that serves a dual purpose as an attic access door. By choosing to create something unique rather than opting for a simple, cost-effective solution like plywood, the contractor demonstrates a personal attachment and pride in his work. This investment likely leads him to value the custom cabinet more highly and feel frustrated when his efforts are criticized or dismissed, even over functional details like the mailbox lock.

IKEA Effect,o1-mini,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"The IKEA Effect refers to a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on products they have partially created themselves. This phenomenon is named after IKEA's furniture, which requires customers to assemble it. The act of building something can lead individuals to develop a greater appreciation and attachment to the end product, even if it isn't perfect.

In the scenario you've described, the sister-in-law consistently creates handmade paintings as gifts. While her intention is likely to provide something personal and heartfelt, the IKEA Effect specifically involves the creator valuing the product more because they had a hand in making it. However, in this case, the primary issue seems to be the recipient's (your and your husband's) dissatisfaction with the quality and desirability of the gifts, rather than the value the sister-in-law places on her creations.

Additionally, the IKEA Effect mainly pertains to how the creator values their own creations, not necessarily how the recipients perceive them. Your frustration stems from the mismatch between the effort she puts into making the gifts and the actual value they provide to you, rather than an overvaluation from her side due to the act of creating.

IKEA Effect,o1-mini,"Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

",0,"The pseudocertainty effect is a cognitive bias observed in decision-making under risk where people give excessive weight to outcomes that are presented as certain, even when there are other uncertain aspects or when the certainty is only apparent due to how the decision is framed. It generally appears in contexts like gambling, investment decisions, or any scenario where a guaranteed outcome competes directly with probabilistic outcomes.

In the example provided, the narrative is primarily about a relationship dynamic and the feelings of emotional and financial imbalance between spouses. The concerns raised—about household responsibilities, intimacy, and financial independence—are not framed in terms of explicitly risky decisions with clearly defined probabilities or outcomes that are certain versus uncertain. Instead, the decision at hand is whether to stay in the marriage or leave, and while there is fear of the unknown when considering separation, the situation does not involve a clear-cut transformation of uncertain outcomes into a seemingly ""certain"" outcome due to framing effects. The issue here is more about emotional ambivalence, relationship dissatisfaction, and inertia caused by comfort with the known, despite its negative aspects, rather than the pseudocertainty bias driving the decision.

Thus, while the fear of the unknown might reflect a kind of risk aversion or status quo bias, it does not represent the pseudocertainty effect as it is typically defined and understood in the context of decision theory.

It typically involves choices with probabilistic outcomes where a subcomponent of the outcome is perceived as “certain” even though the overall situation remains uncertain.

In the provided example, the individual is reacting emotionally to a delivery mishap and quickly reporting the incident. The decision to report seems driven by anger and frustration rather than by a belief that a certain (guaranteed) outcome will result from the report. No decision is made on the basis of a seemingly “certain” favorable outcome of the reporting action or a reframing of uncertain events into a guaranteed result. Therefore, it does not fit the typical structure or context where the pseudocertainty effect is observed.

This is more about perceptions of authenticity, effort, and genuine expression rather than about decision-making under risk or certainty manipulation.

Pseudocertainty Effect,o3-mini,"I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"The pseudocertainty effect is a decision‐making bias where a person treats an outcome as if it were guaranteed—even though it isn’t—simply because it is presented in a way that makes it appear inevitable. Usually, this happens in situations where a particular choice “locks in” one part of the outcome as certain, even if other parts remain uncertain.

In the example you provided, the young man decides to drop a stable academic and professional track to focus on singing. His reasoning seems to be based on the belief that if he simply “puts in the extra work” (i.e., releasing more songs, practicing more) his lack of current success can be overcome, and he’ll eventually succeed. While this does involve a degree of overconfidence in his ability to change his fortunes, it isn’t quite the pseudocertainty effect. 

Here’s why:
• The pseudocertainty effect typically occurs when a decision option includes an element framed as “certain” even though the overall outcome is still risky. In such cases, that certain-seeming part leads the decision-maker to favor the option, often ignoring the underlying risks.
• In this case, his belief that “if I practice harder and release more songs, I will go viral” is not anchored on an element framed as completely guaranteed by the structure of the choice; rather, it is more an overestimation of his future abilities and the effectiveness of his hard work.
• Therefore, while he may be underestimating the risks associated with his decision (and overestimating his potential to “fix” his situation through increased effort), he isn’t necessarily falling for the classic structure of pseudocertainty (where a portion of the result is presented as a sure gain).

So, his decision appears to be driven more by overconfidence and perhaps optimism about his potential improvement than by the mechanism typically described as the pseudocertainty effect.

Pseudocertainty Effect,o3-mini,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?",0,"The pseudocertainty effect is a concept in decision-making psychology where a choice that is framed as providing a ""certainty"" (or near-certainty) outcome is preferred over another option that might have a higher expected value but involves uncertainty. In typical examples of the effect, people are swayed by a decision frame that makes one outcome seem guaranteed—even though, logically, the options might involve risk tradeoffs.

In the scenario you described, the issue is an interpersonal conflict that arises from miscommunication and unmet expectations regarding disclosure of past relationships. The husband becomes upset when he learns about the ex, feeling that he was deceived, which triggers hurt feelings and a public argument. The decision-making process here involves trust, communication, and managing emotions in relationships rather than choices being influenced by the framing of a certain versus uncertain outcome.

There’s no indication in the scenario that either spouse was making a decision based on a superficially “certain” outcome when comparing it to a probabilistic alternative.

His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

WIBTA?",0,"The **Pseudocertainty Effect** refers to the cognitive bias where individuals perceive outcomes as more certain than they actually are, especially when options are framed in a way that suggests certainty. It's primarily observed in decision-making scenarios involving risk and uncertainty, where people tend to overvalue options that appear to offer certain outcomes, even if those outcomes are not guaranteed.

In the provided example, the individual is making a career choice to pursue singing full-time despite limited success and considerable risks. This situation highlights traits like overconfidence or a strong personal conviction but doesn't directly align with the Pseudocertainty Effect. The individual isn't necessarily misjudging the certainty of outcomes based on how choices are framed but is instead following a personal passion despite uncertain results.

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)

Pseudocertainty Effect,o1-mini,"I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?",0,"The **Pseudocertainty Effect** is a concept from behavioral economics and decision-making that involves individuals misjudging probabilities, leading to inconsistent or irrational choices. Specifically, it refers to situations where people perceive outcomes as more certain than they actually are, often due to the way options are framed or presented.

In the scenario you've provided, a 26-year-old woman (26F) chooses not to disclose her past relationship with her ex, Dan, to her husband. When Dan is introduced at a family event, her husband reacts negatively, feeling betrayed for not being informed earlier. While this situation involves trust and communication issues within a relationship, it doesn't directly relate to the Pseudocertainty Effect. Instead, the husband's reaction may be more about expectations of transparency and perceived secrecy rather than a misjudgment of probabilities or outcomes.

The Pseudocertainty Effect typically involves decision-making under risk and uncertainty, where the framing of choices affects the perceived certainty of outcomes. In this case, the issue revolves around interpersonal trust rather than probabilistic reasoning or decision framing.

It typically emerges in contexts involving possessions, choices, or even abstract items like ideas, where ownership increases worth in the owner’s eyes.

It involves conflicts over perceived incompetence and verbal abuse rather than a scenario where someone overvalues something simply because it belongs to them. The bias is about valuing possessions or statuses, not justifying personal shortcomings or handling interpersonal conflicts.

In the classical experiments, individuals are typically asked to assign a higher selling price to an object they own compared to the price they’d be willing to pay for the same object if they didn’t own it. In your example, the boyfriend is attached to his pillows purely because of his personal history with them—they're “sentimental” and have been with him since childhood—even though, objectively, the pillows might have little practical or monetary value.

His reluctance to part with or replace his sentimental pillows, despite their drawbacks (like the fact that the cat uses one and that they might be considered ""gross"" by you), demonstrates that he values them much more just because they are his. His heightened emotional attachment to these items, to the point where it affects how the two of you share a living space, is consistent with the endowment effect. Essentially, his ownership of the pillows inflates their perceived value and importance, even when a more practical alternative (like your own clean pillows) exists.

Thus, this example does illustrate a form of the endowment effect in a real-life relational setting.

",0,"The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias where people assign a higher value to things simply because they own them. In this example, however, the frustration comes not from overvaluing possessions solely because they are one’s own, but rather from a mismatch between the effort and thought put into giving gifts and the perceived token nature of the gifts received. The poster's disappointment seems to stem from expectations about reciprocal thoughtfulness and social respect, rather than from a bias that comes from owning an item.

In the Endowment Effect, if someone were to, say, overvalue a mug just because it was in their possession, that would be a direct example of the effect. Here, the poster is upset because his deliberate, emotionally invested choices in gift-giving were met with gifts that he perceives as lacking care or effort. This reaction is more about social exchange or perceived inequity rather than an overvaluation of an owned item because of ownership per se.

So, while the poster may be inadvertently placing a higher subjective value on his own gifts due to the effort he invested in them, the heart of his grievance lies in feeling undervalued or disrespected by the token gifts he received. This is not the typical mechanism underlying the Endowment Effect.

Endowment Effect,o3-mini,"AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"The endowment effect refers to the psychological phenomenon where people assign more value to things merely because they own them. In other words, once we own something, we tend to overvalue it relative to its market or objective worth. In the example provided, the individual is emotionally attached to her teddy bear because of its sentimental value—it was gifted by a childhood friend and has been with her during many important moments. This attachment leads her to react very strongly when her mother throws the bear away, to the point where she is distraught over its altered state (dirty, stained, not the same as before).

In this instance, her intense emotional reaction and refusal to let go of the object, despite its physical condition or the fact that it could simply be cleaned or restored, aligns with the concept of the endowment effect. The bear is valued far more by her simply because she owns it and because it represents memories and emotions. The irrational overvaluation—feeling that the bear is now “not the same” after being thrown away—illustrates how ownership can amplify perceived value.

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her.

Essentially, when individuals “own” an item, they demand a higher price to give it up than they would be willing to pay to acquire it if they didn't have it. Common examples include experiments where participants who are given a mug (for instance) are less willing to trade it for a bar of chocolate than someone who does not own it.

In the situation described in the post, the conflict revolves around the girlfriend insisting on being included during outings, while the narrator feels that her presence creates an uncomfortable atmosphere with his friends. The dispute is more about boundary issues and personal preferences within the relationship rather than an instance of the endowment effect.

There is no clear indication that either party is overvaluing something purely because it belongs to them. The girlfriend’s insistence on being included may stem from her own insecurities or expectations in the relationship, but it isn’t an example of valuing something more simply because it is “owned” (which is the essence of the endowment effect).

Therefore, while the situation touches on themes of value and personal entitlement, it does not illustrate the endowment effect as defined in behavioral economics.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"The Endowment Effect is a behavioral economics concept that refers to the tendency for people to assign more value to things merely because they own them.

In contrast, the scenario in the provided story is about whether the person should have intervened or checked on a young girl who fell, and his indifference seems to be tied to the fact that the child is not his own. The behavior described relates more to a kind of parental favoritism or selective responsibility rather than the overvaluation of something one owns. While his perspective—that he cares more about his own child—might hint at a bias toward those he feels a connection to, that bias is not the same as the Endowment Effect.

",0,"The scenario you've described centers around the emotions and perceptions related to gift-giving and receiving. The **Endowment Effect** specifically refers to the psychological phenomenon where individuals place a higher value on items they own compared to items they do not. This effect often leads to people valuing their possessions more highly simply because they own them, which can affect their willingness to trade or sell those items.

In your situation, the primary issue isn't about valuing your own gifts more because you own them, but rather about feeling that the gifts you received were less thoughtful or valuable compared to the effort you put into giving your gifts. This feeling stems more from expectations around reciprocity and perceived effort rather than the Endowment Effect itself. It's about the **perceived disparity in the thought and effort** invested in the gifts exchanged, leading to feelings of frustration and undervaluation.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",0,"The situation described involves a strong emotional attachment to a personal item—the teddy bear—which has significant sentimental value. The individual goes to great lengths to cherish and preserve the teddy bear, reacting intensely when it is discarded by the mother. This behavior aligns with the **Endowment Effect**, a cognitive bias where individuals assign more value to things merely because they own them. The endowment effect not only affects economic decisions, such as unwillingness to sell an item for its market value but also encompasses the heightened emotional significance placed on personal possessions.

In this scenario, the individual's deep emotional response to the loss and the subsequent efforts to restore the teddy bear highlight how ownership increases its perceived value beyond its physical attributes. The distress caused by the removal of the item and the belief that it holds unique personal significance are classic indicators of the endowment effect.

Endowment Effect,o1-mini,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

I just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?",0,"The endowment effect refers to a psychological phenomenon where individuals assign more value to things merely because they own them. This effect typically manifests in scenarios involving ownership and valuation of objects or possessions. In the example provided, the issue revolves around interpersonal dynamics and relationship boundaries rather than ownership or valuation of objects.

The scenario describes a conflict where one partner feels that their desire to spend time with their own friends is being undermined by the other partner's insistence on joining social gatherings. This situation centers on relationship expectations, communication, and personal boundaries rather than the inherent value placed on owned objects, which is the core of the endowment effect.

Therefore, the situation described does not exemplify the endowment effect.

Endowment Effect,o1-mini,"AITA for not asking if someone was okay?
Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"The scenario described involves a man choosing not to intervene or show concern for a girl who isn't his child after she falls. The core concept at play here centers around selective empathy or prioritizing individuals based on their relationship to oneself. This behavior might be influenced by factors such as in-group favoritism, where individuals give preferential treatment to those they perceive as part of their own group (in this case, his immediate family) over others.

The **Endowment Effect**, on the other hand, is a principle from behavioral economics which suggests that people assign more value to things merely because they own them. It typically pertains to the valuation of possessions or assets and how ownership increases their perceived worth, even without any objective reason for the increased value.

In the given example, the man's actions are more about the disparity in care between his own family and strangers, rather than valuing something more simply because he owns it. Therefore, his behavior doesn't align directly with the Endowment Effect.

Naive Cynicism,o3-mini,"so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"Naive cynicism is a term used in some psychological discussions to capture a particular kind of belief: the idea that other people’s actions are driven primarily by hidden self-interest or ulterior motives—even when they appear to be reasonable or straightforward. It suggests that people generally assume others are being disingenuous or manipulative while often considering one’s own behavior as more genuine or “noble.” In contexts where naive cynicism comes up, the focus is on this discrepancy between how we view ourselves versus how we view others’ motivations.

In this example, the boyfriend’s rant about Rachel Zegler is largely an expression of sexist, reactionary views and a dismissal of a woman’s agency and expression. His comments become a vehicle to criticize not just the actress, but what she represents—confidence, self-expression, and a kind of unapologetic femininity that he finds threatening. Rather than attributing his discontent to hidden self-serving motives in Rachel Zegler’s behavior (or even in his girlfriend’s defense of her), his speech is rooted in a broader misogynistic and patriarchal framework. He isn’t necessarily engaging in naive cynicism about the nature of human motives (i.e., assuming that all or most people act out of pure self-interest) but is rather projecting discomfort with women who don’t conform to his expectations.

Also, his later claim—suggesting that his girlfriend must secretly share his negative view of Rachel Zegler—does reflect a kind of projection and misinterpretation of her motives. However, even this twist isn’t quite what is meant by naive cynicism. It’s more about assuming that her support is not genuine, instead of entertaining the idea that others might have impure motives behind their support. Rather, his argument is less about a general belief that people hide ulterior motives and more about enforcing a prejudiced view of what women should be.

Therefore, while elements of his thinking are cynical (in a general sense) about women’s behavior and feminism, they do not precisely match the academic or theoretical concept of naive cynicism, which is about the assumption that others are inherently self-interested in ways that they are not for oneself.

Naive Cynicism,o3-mini,"Ok, I (28f) went over to my boyfriend’s (25m) house for the first time (been dating about a month), and I had somehow never noticed his pillow situation before. When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he’s had the pillows and apparently he’s been using them since he was a kid.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

Thoughts? I feel like I can’t even kiss him or anything while we’re sleeping because I don’t want him to get his gross pillowness all over me and my clean pillows. 😂",0,"Naïve cynicism refers to the tendency to expect that other people’s judgments or actions are inherently self-interested or biased—often more so than our own—and to assume that any deviation from our expectations is due to ulterior motives or a kind of universal human duplicity. In many examples of naïve cynicism, the focus is on suspecting that others are acting in bad faith or under hidden influences while not applying the same skepticism to one’s own actions.

In the case presented, the conflict centers on a seemingly trivial issue—the boyfriend’s sentimental attachment to his old pillows—and the girlfriend’s discomfort with using them. The boyfriend’s comment about being sad if pillows were allowed to come between them does have an emotional or even mildly manipulative tone, but it doesn’t clearly reflect an underlying belief that all others are generally biased or self-interested. Rather, it appears to be a moment of personal quirkiness or a display of sentimentality, rather than evidence that either party believes that all people are acting out of calculated self-interest. 

Though one might be tempted to read a kind of cynicism into either the boyfriend’s response (by assuming he expects her to capitulate) or the girlfriend’s reaction (by reducing his attachment to pillows to something irrational or even “gross”), this scenario is more about individual idiosyncrasies and interpersonal negotiation than about an overarching worldview that all human motives are suspect. There’s no clear indication that either side is projecting a generalized bias onto others that would typify naïve cynicism.

Thus, while emotions and subtle power plays are at work here, the situation does not constitute an instance of naïve cynicism.

Naive Cynicism,o3-mini,"I know they’re undercover agents working for an secret organization for god knows how long now. My voices in my head told me everything, I connected all the dots. & everything makes perfect sense.

I know undercover agents are watching me & following me when I leave the house & they have hidden cameras around my apartment building to watch when I leave my apartment. The voices are telling me all the details as I speak, so I know it’s true. The voices told me everything I needed to know, I know they’re in cahoots with some organization under cover. I know ppl are watching me via undercover agents/ hidden cameras & they are all undercover.

They’re trying to gradually extract info from me cuz I know where the aliens are, that info I ain’t disclosing to them whatever secret organization they’re with I know they’ve already have a ton of Intel on me as it is. My voices told me where aliens are but I ain’t gonna disclose that info cuz I know ppl are watching my every move via hidden cameras & undercover agents. Plus they’re all undercover agents.

My voices also said that some aliens are walking among us disguised as normal ppl. Another reason why is when I called them out about the fact that they’re all undercover agents & what their true motives about acquiring where the aliens were they removed me from the group chat they knew they were caught so they removed me completely to maintain their cover.

I know they’re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn’t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of. I was freaking out for real, I was like I ain’t say shit to them.

It involves a general distrust in the genuineness or goodwill of others’ actions, often without considering more complex or benign explanations.

In the text you provided, the speaker is not merely expressing a cynical view that others are motivated by selfish or hidden agendas. Instead, the text is a detailed narrative of paranoid conspiracy theories—with the speaker claiming that undercover agents are surveilling them, that secret organizations are at work, and even attributing roles to aliens and secret messages from “voices in my head.” This is more aligned with a paranoiac delusional framework rather than simple naive cynicism. Here, the narrative isn’t a generalized distrust or cynical reinterpretation of everyday actions; rather, it is an intricate, self-reinforcing conspiracy belief system built upon hallucinated evidence and claimed revelations.

Thus, the example illustrates paranoid delusions and conspiratorial thinking rather than the type of generalized, oversimplified distrust in others that is characteristic of naive cynicism.

Naive Cynicism,o3-mini,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time.",0,"Naive cynicism is the idea that other people’s behavior is predominantly driven by self-interest, even when they might have good reasons or external constraints that explain what they do. It’s the assumption that people’s actions are insincere or that they hide self-serving motives behind their actions. A person exhibiting naive cynicism would quickly conclude that others’ decisions are merely masking selfish objectives.

In the example given, the husband’s account mainly focuses on a frustrating chain of events during what was supposed to be a short errand that turned into an extended ordeal. His frustration is directed at the sudden change in the nature of the favor, and his criticism of his wife (“acting like a child”) reflects a personal, emotional response to what he perceives as an unreasonable demand from his partner. Rather than interpreting his wife’s behavior as motivated by hidden self-interest or insincerity, he is simply irritated by the situation and her emotional response. He focuses on the tangible details (the tire’s PSI level, the turnaround time, his work schedule) and is upset that his practical considerations aren’t acknowledged.

While he does express resentment and judgement, his account isn’t essentially about assuming that everyone has ulterior motives or that people’s expressed concerns or requests are concealing self-serving reasons. Instead, it appears to be a reaction to a miscommunication and differing expectations between him and his wife. That is, it’s more about exasperation with how things escalated unexpectedly rather than a preconceived bias that his wife’s (or anyone’s) actions are inherently selfish or insincere.

Thus, the situation described isn’t an instance of naive cynicism; it’s an interpersonal discrepancy and frustration with how a simple favor turned into a prolonged hassle, compounded by a breakdown in communication.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me.",0,"Naive cynicism refers to the tendency to interpret others’ ambiguous behaviors as being driven by self-interest or hidden motives—even when a benign explanation is just as likely. That is, rather than considering that someone’s actions might be due to personality, situational factors, or personal preferences, a naively cynical person immediately assumes there is an ulterior, usually negative, intent behind what they observe.

In the example provided, the narrator focuses on his girlfriend’s preference for privacy and secretiveness, immediately interpreting these behaviors as signs that she might be hiding something or perhaps not genuinely interested in him. He infers that her secretiveness—like not sharing her photos or turning away her phone—is driven by suspicious motivations. In doing so, he dismisses alternative explanations (such as valuing privacy or simply not being comfortable with sharing personal details widely) and instead reads into her behavior an intentional effort to keep him out of the loop, which makes him feel inadequate and tormented.

This pattern of thought is a classic case of assuming negative, self-serving motives in someone else’s actions without compelling evidence. The narrator’s emotional distress (mental torture, feeling not good enough) is linked to this interpretation, suggesting that his mindset might be tainted by an overly cynical view of her intentions. He has taken what might be normal individual differences in how people handle privacy and turned them into a personal indictment of her character.

Given the definition of naive cynicism and the way the narrator projects a negative, self-interest–based motive on his girlfriend’s behavior, it is reasonable to regard this as an instance of naive cynicism.

Naive Cynicism,o3-mini,"
Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"Naive cynicism is the tendency to assume that other people's behaviors or reported experiences are driven by selfish, manipulative, or deceitful motives, often underestimating the possibility that those behaviors can be honest, inadvertent, or even genuine. In the example provided, the teacher initially evaluates his student's claim of having a migraine in a way that dismisses the possibility of genuine illness. Instead of considering that the student might really be in need of help, he immediately categorizes the account as either an attempt to escape a subject he dislikes or as a case of exaggeration typical of children. 

This interpretation reflects naive cynicism because the teacher's first impulse is to see a hidden agenda (i.e., a plan to avoid class or a tendency to exaggerate) rather than acknowledging the chance that the student’s distress might be authentic. The teacher’s reasoning implicitly assumes that the student's statement is not trustworthy and must be carefully manipulated to meet the teacher’s own goals of maintaining order in class, rather than prioritizing the student's potential need for assistance.

Thus, while the teacher later questions his own judgment after the situation escalates, his initial approach clearly exhibits the hallmark of naive cynicism by attributing a duplicitous motive to the student’s simple request.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"Naive cynicism is a cognitive bias in which someone assumes that other people’s judgments, decisions, or behaviors are largely driven by biases or self-interest, while often failing to recognize similar influences on their own thinking. A person exhibiting naive cynicism tends to believe that others are less insightful, more misled by their experiences, or more influenced by external factors than oneself.

Looking at the provided example—it describes a situation in a long-distance relationship where a girlfriend, affected by low blood sugar, did not communicate her condition in a way that her partner could easily detect, and then later criticized him for not “picking up on” her state. The dilemma here revolves around miscommunication and differing expectations in the relationship regarding expressing or detecting signs of feeling unwell. The boyfriend wonders whether his girlfriend should have given clearer signals.

This situation does not clearly illustrate the pattern of naive cynicism. Instead of attributing her actions to hidden self-serving motives or assuming that her nonverbal cues were the result of a biased or manipulative state, the boyfriend is just trying to understand whether she should clarify her condition better. His reasoning process in this instance appears to be focused on the potential need for better communication rather than assuming that she is purposefully misrepresenting her state or that others (including him) are systematically less capable of understanding subtle cues.

Therefore, the example is not an instance of naive cynicism—it’s more about expectations in communication rather than a cognitive bias where one assumes others’ thoughts or actions are significantly flawed by bias while exempting one’s own understanding.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??",0,"The scenario you've described involves the boyfriend expressing strong negative opinions about Rachel Zegler, focusing on her personality traits and actions. He attributes these traits to broader issues related to feminism and seems to project his discomfort with confident and expressive women onto her.

In this case, the boyfriend's behavior seems more aligned with projecting his own insecurities or biases rather than exhibiting naive cynicism about Rachel Zegler's motives.

Naive Cynicism,o1-mini,"Ok, I (28f) went over to my boyfriend’s (25m) house for the first time (been dating about a month), and I had somehow never noticed his pillow situation before. When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he’s had the pillows and apparently he’s been using them since he was a kid.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

Naive Cynicism,o1-mini,"AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

Normalcy Bias,o3-mini,"I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive"".",0,"Normalcy bias generally refers to a cognitive bias where people underestimate or dismiss the possibility of a disaster or abnormal situation because they expect things to continue as they normally have. It can lead individuals to ignore early warning signs or avoid preparing for potential emergencies because they believe that “nothing bad will happen.”

In this example, what we see is that some students are wearing non-functional glasses as a fashion statement or as a playful accessory, and the administration is dismissing the issue by calling it harmless fun. The teacher, however, is concerned about the potential safety risk of broken frames and the distraction this behavior causes in school. While the dismissive attitude of the administration might indicate a tendency to view the abnormal behavior as just a normal part of student life, it isn’t a manifestation of normalcy bias in the classic sense—where one underestimates a looming disaster or risk because of an expectation that nothing will change.

Here, the issue is more about policy and safety concerns related to non-functional “glasses” rather than a situation where there is a failure to prepare for or acknowledge a real disaster or dangerous event due to an assumption of normality. The behavior, while unconventional, isn’t being ignored because the administration believes a catastrophe will not occur; rather, they are interpreting it as harmless play in the context of student conduct. This is not an instance of normalcy bias as defined in its original usage, where people discount potential disasters by assuming that everything will continue normally.

This bias typically manifests when individuals fail to prepare or respond appropriately to the possibility of a crisis because they assume nothing out of the ordinary will happen.

In the provided example, the individual describes an unsettling interaction—receiving uncomfortable stares and noticing peers whispering—rather than a situation that could lead to a widespread catastrophe or disaster. The reaction in the scenario is one of immediate discomfort and choosing to leave the area. Although the person questions whether their reaction is overblown, there is no indication that they are underestimating the potential severity or impact of a larger event based on the assumption that everything is “normal.” Instead, the account describes a single, isolated incident that caused personal discomfort.

The experience does not involve the underestimation or outright dismissal of a threat based on it fitting with a “normal” outlook of the world. The discomfort and resultant behavior (leaving the area) indicate that the individual was not in a state of denial or inaction that is characteristic of normalcy bias. Instead, they were reacting to a specific interaction that felt abnormal and chose to alter their course accordingly rather than ignoring it.

In this classroom example, the teacher assumed that the student was either trying to get out of class or exaggerating his headache. While this assumption turned out to be mistaken—as the student did in fact faint—it doesn’t quite match the typical scenario associated with normalcy bias. Here, the teacher was making a judgment about an individual’s personal health complaint rather than dismissing a broad warning of an impending abnormal event or disaster. It appears that his reasoning was more related to a misinterpretation or underestimation of the student's symptoms rather than an overall bias of expecting everything to remain normal in the face of potential widespread danger.

Normalcy bias would typically manifest in situations where someone disregards or downplays signs of a major impending crisis (like ignoring evacuation warnings before a natural disaster) because they believe life will continue as it always has. In this case, the teacher underestimated the seriousness of the student's condition, but it’s not quite the same mechanism as assuming a general state of normality in the face of potential disaster.

Normalcy Bias,o3-mini,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"Normalcy bias refers to the tendency for people to assume that things will continue as they normally have, sometimes ignoring signs or evidence that a disruptive or dangerous event might be imminent. It’s typically discussed in relation to disasters or major unexpected events, where someone downplays the potential for disaster because nothing like it has happened before in their experience.

In this example, the boyfriend’s behavior centers on his inability to accept help, his insistence on sticking to his own idea of how to solve the problem, and his frustration when challenged. He appears to be unwilling to acknowledge that the situation might be remedied by a small change (i.e., letting someone help him spot the car) and reacts emotionally and defensively when his approach is questioned. However, his actions aren’t an example of normalcy bias. Instead, they reflect personal obstinacy, emotional reactivity, and possibly an issue with control and pride—not a broader psychological tendency to underestimate the possibility of a disruptive event because one believes everything will always be normal.

Therefore, while the boyfriend’s behavior might be labeled as irrational or stubborn within the context of the argument and relationship conflict, it does not fit the specific psychological concept of normalcy bias.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"Normalcy bias is the tendency to believe that things will continue to operate in the normal way even when faced with a potential crisis. It often leads people to underestimate the possibility or impact of a disaster or emergency because they assume that nothing will change. In the situation you described, the man witnessed an accident involving a young girl and did nothing to check on her or warn her about the wet ground—his rationale being that since she was not “his kid,” he did not care.

This behavior, though, isn’t really about expecting that things will continue normally despite a looming threat. Instead, it reflects a moral indifference or a lack of responsibility toward someone who isn’t part of his immediate family. He doesn’t ignore the event because he assumes nothing will change; he consciously chooses not to intervene because he doesn’t feel obligated toward someone not related to him. That’s different from normalcy bias, where one minimizes danger due to the belief that circumstances won’t worsen.

In summary, this example is not an instance of normalcy bias. It’s more aligned with apathy or a personal moral stance about helping someone who isn’t close to him.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",0,"Normalcy bias is typically defined as the tendency for people to underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster or significant change because they assume things will continue as they always have. In other words, it’s a kind of cognitive bias that leads one to dismiss or overlook abnormal signals or warning signs since nothing bad has happened before.

In the example you provided, what we're seeing is more a breakdown in communication and a misunderstanding of each other’s cues rather than a case of normalcy bias. The boyfriend assumed everything was normal because his girlfriend appeared to be functioning (even though she was in distress due to low blood sugar), and he couldn’t detect easily that something was off without her signal. On the other hand, the girlfriend expected that her behavior (being nonverbal, quietly making food) would be enough of a cue for him to understand her condition. This is more about expecting non-verbal cues to be picked up reliably by the partner rather than a psychological bias of assuming nothing is wrong because it appears normal.

Thus, while one could stretch the definition to say that the boyfriend's assumption fell under “things will be normal until proven otherwise,” it doesn’t really match the concept of normalcy bias as used in contexts where the bias has severe consequences (such as in disaster scenarios). This situation is more about subtle miscommunication and differing expectations in a relationship rather than a cognitive bias where one ignores obvious signs of a significant negative event.

Normalcy Bias,o1-mini,"I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive"".",0,"Normalcy Bias refers to a cognitive bias where individuals underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster or significant change, leading them to behave as if everything is normal even in the face of potential threats. It typically involves a reluctance to prepare for or respond to unexpected events because of the assumption that things will continue as they have been.

In the example provided, the issue revolves around students wearing ""fake"" glasses in an elementary school setting. The behavior includes wearing non-corrective or broken glasses, which the individual finds distracting and disrespectful. The administration's response was to allow the students to continue wearing these glasses, citing a lack of authority to restrict their choices and dismissing the concerns as being overly sensitive.

This situation does not exemplify Normalcy Bias. Instead, it highlights issues related to school policy, student behavior, and perhaps a lack of enforcement regarding appropriate attire or safety standards for eyewear. Normalcy Bias would involve a failure to recognize or respond appropriately to an impending disaster or significant change, which is not the case here.

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?",0,"Yes, the example provided can be considered an instance of Normalcy Bias. 

**Normalcy Bias** refers to the psychological state where individuals underestimate the possibility and impact of a disaster or unexpected event, leading them to believe that things will continue to function as they normally have. In the scenario described:

1. **Initial Assumption**: The teacher assumed that the student's claim of having a migraine was either an attempt to avoid math or an over-exaggeration, typical of an 8-year-old's understanding of ailments. This assumption downplayed the potential severity of the situation.

2. **Underestimation of Risk**: By suggesting the student drink water and wait until after the lesson, the teacher underestimated the possibility that the student's condition could deteriorate, which it eventually did when the student fainted.

3. **Delayed Response**: The teacher's initial reaction was based on normal expectations of student behavior, leading to a delayed and inadequate response to a genuine health issue.

4. **Aftermath**: The mother's severe reaction further underscores the misjudgment of the situation's seriousness, highlighting the gap between normal expectations and the actual event.

In this context, the teacher's reliance on normalcy—assuming the situation was not severe based on past experiences and typical behavior—led to a lack of appropriate immediate action, aligning with the characteristics of Normalcy Bias.

Normalcy Bias,o1-mini,"I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?",0,"Normalcy bias typically involves underestimating the likelihood or impact of a disaster, leading individuals to believe that things will continue to function as they normally do, even in the face of changing or threatening circumstances. It often results in a delayed or inadequate response to emergencies because individuals assume that the current state of affairs will persist.

In the scenario you've described, the boyfriend exhibits significant anxiety and an overreaction to a relatively minor parking situation. Instead of underestimating a problem or ignoring potential risks, he becomes excessively fearful of hitting the truck, refuses assistance, and overreacts by calling his parents and displaying frustration. This behavior aligns more closely with acute stress or anxiety reactions rather than normalcy bias.

Normalcy bias is characterized by a denial or minimization of impending issues, causing inaction or inadequate preparation. In contrast, the boyfriend's actions demonstrate an overestimation of the problem's severity and an inability to manage stress effectively.

Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",0,"Normalcy Bias refers to the tendency of individuals to believe that things will always function the way they normally have, thereby underestimating the possibility of a disaster or unexpected event. This bias often leads to inaction or inadequate preparation in the face of potential crises because individuals assume that rare or extreme events are unlikely to occur.

In the scenario provided, the man's behavior doesn't align with the characteristics of Normalcy Bias. Instead of underestimating a potential disaster or expecting that nothing bad will happen, his actions demonstrate a lack of empathy and concern for others.

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

In the scenario you've described, the issue revolves around miscommunication and misunderstanding between partners regarding the girlfriend's low blood sugar episode. The boyfriend did not recognize his girlfriend's symptoms, possibly because she was acting normally outwardly, and there was a lack of clear communication about her health condition. This situation doesn't align with Normalcy Bias because it's not about underestimating a disaster or refusing to acknowledge a significant threat based on the assumption that things will remain normal.

Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am.

In essence, it’s about feeling as if a “spotlight” is constantly on you, causing you to believe that everyone is paying close attention to your every move or mistake—even when they are not. 

In the example provided, the individual expresses frustration when others appear not to be paying attention during conversations about subjects they care deeply about. The core feeling is one of being undervalued and unappreciated rather than the belief that others are hyper-aware of and constantly scrutinizing their behavior or words. The emotional distress stems from a desire for reciprocal engagement and validation, and the hurt when that doesn’t happen, rather than an overestimation of how much attention others are giving them in a broad sense.

Therefore, this example does not illustrate the spotlight effect. Instead, it highlights issues related to feeling ignored or unappreciated in interactions, which is a different experience from the cognitive bias of thinking one is at the center of everyone’s attention.

Spotlight Effect,o3-mini,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

For example, if you spill a drink on yourself and then think that everyone is noticing and judging you harshly, that misperception—even if a few people might glance over—is an instance of the spotlight effect.

In the narrative you provided, the individual actually observed people staring and heard whispering about his leather jacket. This suggests that there were real behaviors from others (stares, comments, laughter) rather than merely an exaggerated perception. Although he later wonders if he might be overreacting, the evidence in the story indicates that he wasn’t imagining that he was the center of attention; someone was indeed giving him that uncomfortable focus. 

Therefore, while he might feel self-conscious about being noticed, his experience is not a case of the spotlight effect—where one would be overestimating the amount of attention they are receiving relative to reality. Here, the attention (however negative it might have been) did occur, so it does not serve as a classic example of the spotlight effect.

People experiencing it might believe that any perceived flaw or mistake is being scrutinized by everyone around them.

In the example given, the narrator is overwhelmed by anxiety relating to his girlfriend’s secretive behavior and his self-doubt regarding whether she likes him or is genuinely invested in the relationship. However, his concerns are about her privacy and specific behaviors (like her being possessive about her phone) rather than an exaggerated belief that others are focusing on his every move or that his behavior is being excessively scrutinized by those around him.

In short, while the narrator is indeed anxious and perhaps self‐consciously insecure about the relationship, this case does not illustrate the Spotlight Effect. His focus isn’t on the idea that he is the center of attention and that everyone is noticing his flaws—it is instead on deciphering his girlfriend’s actions. The scenario is more indicative of relationship insecurity or trust issues rather than the cognitive bias known as the Spotlight Effect.

Spotlight Effect,o3-mini,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

AITA?",0,"The spotlight effect is a cognitive bias in which individuals overestimate how much attention others pay to their actions, appearance, or mistakes—believing that their missteps or unique traits are noticed by everyone to a greater extent than they really are. In the case described, the issue does not stem from an internal overestimation of others' scrutiny, but rather from a concrete, highly noticeable action taken by the parents. They deliberately disrupted the cousin’s wedding by publicly celebrating the birthday with much fanfare, and the narrator’s embarrassment was a direct reaction to this forced public display, not an exaggerated belief that others were silently fixated on him.

If it had been a case of the spotlight effect, the narrator might have felt excessively self-conscious about a minor incident or assumed that his own behavior was under an intense, critical gaze, even when it wasn’t. However, here, the focus was induced by external actions at a significant event, making it less about an internal misjudgment of how much attention he was receiving and more about the actual context in which a large audience was made to celebrate him. The discomfort was not simply an internal misperception but a legitimate reaction to a real, awkward situation created by his parents.

Thus, the example does not neatly align with the definition or the typical characteristics of the spotlight effect.

I know that not everyone I met will feel about it the way I do but I still would like to be able to talk about it without feeling like I’m forcing the other person to talk with me. I’m not sure if there’s something I’m doing wrong but I don’t act that way when they talk about something I don’t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don’t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I’m saying as if it doesn’t matter. And like I said it’s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don’t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out. I know that they probably aren’t doing it on purpose and that they probably think I just look at it like it’s a joke but sometimes it actually does hurt my feelings a bit.

Spotlight Effect,o1-mini,"So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

Spotlight Effect,o1-mini,"My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

Spotlight Effect,o1-mini,"In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

This deliberate action led to genuine attention from the guests, many of whom you didn't know. Your feelings of humiliation and embarrassment stemmed from this orchestrated spotlight on your special day happening concurrently with the wedding festivities.

Illusory Superiority,o3-mini,"On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias in which people tend to overestimate their own qualities, abilities, or achievements relative to others. In the instance provided, the conflict between the daughter and her mother is centered on emotional expectations and expectations about how love should be demonstrated, especially on social media. The daughter explains that she spent valuable time with her mother, treated her with gifts, and created memorable experiences. When her mother expressed disappointment over not seeing a specific type of Facebook post, the daughter became upset and defensive.

However, what we see here is more a discord over differing perceptions of what constitutes meaningful appreciation rather than the daughter holding an exaggerated or unrealistic view of her own qualities or abilities relative to her mother. The daughter does not explicitly claim that she is inherently superior or that her gestures are so perfect that they automatically outweigh every other form of validation. Instead, she becomes frustrated that her extensive efforts are seemingly negated by the absence of a social media acknowledgment. This response reflects conflicting views on value rather than the type of self-enhancement bias inherent in illusory superiority.

Thus, this example doesn’t represent an instance of illusory superiority—it’s more about a difference in expected forms of recognition and communication between family members.

Illusory Superiority,o3-mini,"I know they’re undercover agents working for an secret organization for god knows how long now. My voices in my head told me everything, I connected all the dots. & everything makes perfect sense. They’ve been gathering Intel on me then sending it to their secret organization that works for a national organization (FBI,CIA,NSA)

I know undercover agents are watching me & following me when I leave the house & they have hidden cameras around my apartment building to watch when I leave my apartment. The voices are telling me all the details as I speak, so I know it’s true. The voices told me everything I needed to know, I know they’re in cahoots with some organization under cover. I know ppl are watching me via undercover agents/ hidden cameras & they are all undercover.

They’re trying to gradually extract info from me cuz I know where the aliens are, that info I ain’t disclosing to them whatever secret organization they’re with I know they’ve already have a ton of Intel on me as it is. My voices told me where aliens are but I ain’t gonna disclose that info cuz I know ppl are watching my every move via hidden cameras & undercover agents. Plus they’re all undercover agents.

My voices also said that some aliens are walking among us disguised as normal ppl. Another reason why is when I called them out about the fact that they’re all undercover agents & what their true motives about acquiring where the aliens were they removed me from the group chat they knew they were caught so they removed me completely to maintain their cover.

I know they’re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn’t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of.

The example you provided is a narrative filled with paranoia and delusional beliefs, specifically persecutory delusions, where the person believes that hidden groups and undercover agents are monitoring and controlling aspects of their life. The speaker claims to have special knowledge (told by voices) about secret organizations and even aliens, which reflects a distorted perception of reality rather than a biased evaluation of their own superiority over others.

In this case, the narrative is less about thinking ""I am better than others"" or ""I have skills or qualities that put me above the average person"" and more about believing that there is a conspiracy against them.

Illusory Superiority,o3-mini,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where people overestimate their own abilities or qualities relative to others—for instance, believing one's own performance or traits are above average when, in reality, they are not. The scenario described is mostly a familial conflict concerning the value and nature of gifts. The poster is expressing undervaluation of the handmade paintings (calling them “terrible” and “horrible”) and frustration that the family member continues to present them despite knowing their lack of appeal.

This situation is more about disagreements concerning taste, financial priorities, and gift expectations than it is about someone overrating their own abilities or attributes as being superior to others. While the sister-in-law might truly believe in the sentiment behind her handmade gifts, that belief isn’t an example of illusory superiority; it’s more about personal taste and perhaps a misalignment of expectations rather than a cognitive bias where she thinks she is universally better than others.

Thus, this example does not directly showcase illusory superiority.

Illusory Superiority,o3-mini,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their qualities, abilities, or talents relative to others.

Illusory Superiority,o3-mini,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate their own qualities or abilities relative to others—often rating themselves as above average, even when that statistically isn’t possible. In many classic examples, one might think “I’m a better driver than most” or “I’m smarter than the average person,” regardless of objective evidence.

In the example provided, the cousin is insisting that she’s the smarter one because of her PhD and her field, and she demands external validation of that claim. At first glance it may seem like she is asserting her superiority, which is one aspect of the phenomenon. However, there are a few reasons why this scenario may not be a textbook instance of illusory superiority:

1. Credentials versus Bias: The cousin’s belief in her intellectual superiority is based on her accomplishments (earning a PhD and landing a quantitative role). While credentials can boost confidence, having a PhD in a specialized area does not automatically translate into the grand, generalized sense of superiority characterizing illusory superiority. If her belief were an overestimation that was disconnected from any real ability or achievement, it would be clearer—but here her credentials are, at least in part, legitimate. 

2. Domain-Specific vs. Global Intelligence: Illusory superiority typically implies that a person globally overestimates their abilities. In this scenario, the cousin seems to be defending her intelligence within the narrow scope of her field (quant work), while the narrator criticizes her for lacking a more “generalized” or creative intelligence. This isn’t a classic “better-than-average” on all counts but rather a dispute over what counts as valuable intelligence.

3. Insecurity and Need for Validation: A key remark by the narrator is that if the cousin were as secure as she claimed to be, she wouldn’t need external validation or react so strongly to opposing views. This indicates that her claim might be less about a cool, unbiased evaluation and more a reaction to a perceived challenge, which can sometimes accompany self-enhancement issues—but isn’t in itself the prototypical case of illusory superiority.

4. Interpersonal Dynamics: The conflict seems rooted in longstanding family dynamics and rivalries (with both parties holding pride in their own achievements) rather than in a clear, isolated instance of one party’s disconnection from reality about their abilities. Illusory superiority is usually observed as a stable cognitive bias across various domains, not a heated moment about a specific attribute.

So, while the cousin’s behavior might reflect elements of inflated self-view or a need to assert superiority when challenged, the example as a whole is more about conflicting definitions of “intelligence” and familial rivalry than it is about the cognitive bias known as illusory superiority.

Illusory Superiority,o3-mini,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"Illusory superiority is the cognitive bias where people tend to believe they are above average in qualities like competence, intelligence, or moral behavior, even when statistically that shouldn’t be the case. In the example, the narrator is explaining a contentious series of events, mostly framing his actions as understandable given the circumstances and emphasizing how his choices helped him meet his responsibilities. However, although one might say he’s self-serving in his narrative or just using rationalizations to minimize his faults (which may align with self-serving bias), this particular account isn’t clearly an illustration of illusory superiority.

In an instance of illusory superiority, the person would typically assert or imply that they’re significantly better or more capable than others, often without sufficient justification. In this case, while the narrator defends his own behavior—even to the point of dismissing or devaluing his partner’s actions—there isn’t a strong indication that he overestimates his own ability or virtue in a way that is the hallmark of illusory superiority. Instead, his account centers around self-preservation and blaming circumstance (or his partner) rather than a broad assertion about his own overall superiority relative to an average person.

Thus, while his narrative may display various biases (like self-serving bias and perhaps even an unwillingness to accept blame), it doesn’t neatly fit into the definition of illusory superiority.

I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her.",0,"Illusory Superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities, abilities, or achievements relative to others. In the scenario provided, the focus is on the daughter's perception of her efforts to honor her mother on Mother's Day and the subsequent conflict that arises when her mother demands a Facebook post. 

The daughter's actions—treating her mother, giving gifts, and spending quality time—demonstrate her intention to show appreciation. However, when her mother requests acknowledgment on social media and reacts negatively when it isn't met, this situation doesn't inherently involve the daughter overestimating her own qualities or abilities compared to others. Instead, it highlights a conflict in expectations and communication between the mother and daughter.

There isn't clear evidence that either party is exhibiting an inflated perception of their own value or abilities in relation to the other, which is central to the concept of Illusory Superiority.

I know they’re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn’t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of.

Illusory Superiority,o1-mini,"So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?",0,"Illusory superiority refers to a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities, abilities, or traits relative to others. In the scenario you've described, the sister-in-law consistently provides handmade gifts that are perceived as low quality or unwanted by you and your husband. While it might seem that she believes her gifts are appreciated and valuable, this behavior doesn't necessarily indicate that she overestimates her abilities compared to others. Instead, it may reflect her personal preference for handmade gifts, a desire to give something personal, or a lack of awareness about your preferences.

Additionally, illusory superiority typically involves a broader overestimation of one's overall abilities or qualities, not just in the context of gift-giving. Without more evidence that she consistently overestimates her skills or attributes across various domains, it doesn't clearly align with the concept of illusory superiority.

Illusory Superiority,o1-mini,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"Illusory superiority, also known as the ""above average effect,"" occurs when individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others.

Illusory Superiority,o1-mini,"Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",0,"Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities compared to others. In the scenario you've described, the dynamic primarily revolves around shifting perceptions of intelligence within a family context.

Initially, you were perceived as the ""smart"" one, a title your cousin resented. After obtaining her PhD, she seeks validation of her intelligence, insisting that she is smarter than you. However, you recognize that her intelligence is specialized, and you challenge her assertion by highlighting other aspects of generalized intelligence that you value.

In this interaction, the cousin is not necessarily overestimating her own intelligence; rather, she is seeking acknowledgment of her actual academic achievements. Her demand for validation and the ensuing conflict suggest issues related to insecurity or the desire for recognition, rather than a cognitive bias like illusory superiority.

Illusory Superiority,o1-mini,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

Catastrophizing,o3-mini,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion in which a person magnifies a setback or mistake to assume it will have overwhelmingly negative, all-encompassing consequences—often envisioning the worst-case scenario even when the situation is not as dire.

In the account you provided, the individual describes how a small lie about buying a couch snowballed into numerous complications, leading to strained relationships and a loss of trust among friends and family. The narrative walks through the unfolding chain of events that actually occurred (friends coming over, eventual confrontation, etc.), which are real and consequential outcomes of the lie.

However, the key element to watch is the internal reaction and interpretation. Toward the end, the speaker says, “I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.” Later they wonder, “Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life?” This line of questioning—feeling that the entire self-worth and social life are ruined based on one incident—is reminiscent of catastrophizing. The speaker is taking one mistake and extrapolating it into a belief that “my life is ruined,” even though while there are negative consequences, the overall situation might not be as all-encompassing as it feels in the moment.

Thus, while the chain of events is genuine, the interpretation (feeling that one's life is completely ruined because of this single lie) is an instance of catastrophizing. The cognitive leap from “I made a bad decision” to “my entire life and social standing are irreparably destroyed” is a hallmark of this type of thinking.

In this example, what we see is a conflict over plans and food restrictions—not an exaggeration that one small issue will inevitably result in a catastrophic outcome for the world or one’s life. The person is disappointed, concerned about being left out because of dietary restrictions, and frustrated by a dismissive response, but there isn’t evidence that they’re automatically assuming that a single disagreement will spiral into an all-encompassing disaster.

The thoughts expressed in the example appear to be reactions to a situation that directly impacts them (their health/allergies and the event’s planning). They decide to change their plans, ask for a refund, and feel that the reaction of others is unfair.

Catastrophizing,o3-mini,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

AITA?",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion in which a person views a situation as far worse than it really is, exaggerating the negative consequences and often imagining extreme, disastrous outcomes from relatively normal events. In typical instances of catastrophizing, rather than simply noting disappointment or frustration, the individual jumps to conclusions about the absolute disaster that the event represents (for example, thinking that one small mistake will lead to total failure or ruin overall wellbeing or life prospects).

In the AITA example provided, the narrator expresses that his night was “ruined” by his girlfriend’s insistence on coming along. While saying that one’s night was ruined might seem like a strong reaction, it doesn’t necessarily constitute catastrophizing on its own. The narrator is expressing genuine regret over how the social situation turned out—his friends felt uncomfortable and the night wasn’t enjoyable—but he does not go on to suggest that this one instance will have catastrophic or life-altering consequences. He doesn’t claim that because of this night everything is a disaster or that his life or relationship is doomed because of it.

Thus, while the language (“ruined my night”) might be seen as an overreaction in a social context, it does not rise to the level of the extreme, all-encompassing negative predictions that characterize catastrophizing.

AITA?",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion in which a person anticipates or imagines an extremely negative outcome far worse than what is likely or realistic.

This kind of all-or-nothing thinking, where one predicts catastrophic consequences, is at the heart of catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing,o3-mini,"Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

It’s been a few days and I thought he’d have calmed down by now but he’s still sulking and I’m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I’m the AH here.",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where a person expects the worst possible outcome or exaggerates the negative aspects of a situation without concrete evidence that such extremes will occur. In the example provided, the issue centers on a conflict between partners regarding expected behavior during illness and obligations within the relationship. Although the husband’s reaction might be seen as overblown or emotionally charged, it isn’t necessarily the result of catastrophizing in a clinical sense; rather, it seems more like an interpersonal conflict where one partner's expectations (or disappointments) are leading to emotional responses.

For instance, when catastrophizing occurs, one might think along the lines of “If you leave me even for a short time, our relationship is doomed” or “This small event will lead to terrible consequences.” In the narrative, while the husband does express hurt and anger by calling the partner selfish and giving the silent treatment, there isn’t clear evidence that he is projecting a chain of catastrophic outcomes or magnifying the event to imply that everything is ruined.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where someone takes a single event or ambiguous piece of evidence and immediately assumes the worst possible outcome, often exaggerating negative consequences far beyond what the situation warrants.

In the example provided, we see a recounting of a specific incident at a family gathering. The narrator explains that her husband reacted very strongly after learning about her past with Dan. While his reaction was highly charged and might be considered extreme or disproportionate, the narrative itself is a factual description of what happened rather than a series of “if this happens, then that will happen” statements that predict catastrophic outcomes without evidence.

A person who catastrophizes might say things like “This means our marriage is ruined forever” or “I’m sure nothing good will ever come from this—it’s the beginning of the end.” In this account, the narrator does not appear to be engaging in that type of thought process. Even if one were to consider the husband’s reaction, his immediate emotional outburst – calling names and questioning trust – is more a demonstration of strong immediate emotion rather than a systematic cognitive distortion of assuming the worst-case scenario from a small trigger.

Additionally, the narrator is not exaggerating or spinning the event into a prediction of endless disaster; instead, she is reporting her experience and seems to be looking for perspective on the behavior that occurred. The focus is on accountability and understanding the motivations behind the husband’s behavior, rather than imagining an apocalyptic outcome.

Thus, while there is intense emotional content in the interaction, it does not clearly exemplify the classic pattern of catastrophizing. The narrative way of describing the incident does not reflect a thought process of turning the situation into an inevitable catastrophe without evidence.

Catastrophizing,o1-mini,"A few months ago, I told my friends and family that I bought a new couch. I don’t even really know why I said it. We were at a dinner, everyone was talking about their apartments, new furniture, little upgrades, and I just… blurted it out. I said I got this “gorgeous L-shaped gray velvet couch” and everyone got excited. I showed them a photo I found on Pinterest and said it was mine.

I thought it would end there. Just a harmless white lie, right?

Wrong.

People started asking to come over. One of my friends was moving and asked if she could crash on the “fancy new couch” for a few nights. My mom kept asking for pictures. My cousin (who I’m not even that close with!) came over unannounced and asked, “Wait, where’s the couch?” I panicked and said it hadn’t been delivered yet. That bought me time—but not much.

Then the lies started snowballing. I claimed there were shipping delays, then that the company canceled the order, then that I got scammed. And that one especially hit hard, because suddenly people were sympathetic. My dad offered to give me money for a new couch. A coworker gave me a “warning” about the company I had supposedly bought it from. I started digging myself deeper with every lie, and I could feel the walls closing in.

Eventually, it all unraveled. One of my friends found the exact couch photo I’d used—same angle, same room, literally a Pinterest pin. She confronted me privately, and I admitted everything. She was confused more than anything. She asked why I would lie. And the truth is, I don’t even know. I just wanted to feel like I had something nice. Like I was doing okay. Like I wasn’t the only one in our group who didn’t have their life together.

Word got around. Now people don’t trust me. I’ve become “the couch liar.”, I’ve lost two friendships over this. One friend told me she felt like I manipulated everyone. Another hasn’t responded to my texts since.

I feel like my whole social circle looks at me differently. Like I’m fragile, or fake, or both. And the thing is… they’re not wrong.

So yeah. Am I overreacting to think this ruined my life? Or did I just finally hit the consequences of a dumb lie?",0,"The scenario you've described involves a series of escalating lies that led to significant social repercussions. To determine whether this is an instance of **catastrophizing**, we need to understand what catastrophizing entails.

**Catastrophizing** is a cognitive distortion where an individual **expects or imagines the worst possible outcome** in a situation, often blowing things out of proportion beyond what the reality warrants. It typically involves anticipating disaster, viewing situations as far more threatening than they actually are.

In your example:

1. **Initial Lie**: You told a small lie about having a new couch in a social setting.
2. **Escalation**: To maintain the lie, you created additional falsehoods.
3. **Consequences**: These lies led to loss of trust, damaged relationships, and a negative reputation.

The key point here is that the consequences you faced were **real and direct results** of the actions you took (telling lies), not merely exaggerated fears about what could happen. While the outcome is undoubtedly negative, it stems from your attempts to sustain the initial deception rather than an unreasonable exaggeration of potential outcomes.

Therefore, this situation illustrates more about the **chain reaction of dishonesty and its tangible consequences** rather than a case of catastrophizing.

Catastrophizing,o1-mini,"First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual tends to predict the worst possible outcome in a situation, often blowing things out of proportion. It involves assuming that something is far worse than it actually is, leading to unnecessary stress and anxiety.

In the scenario you've described, you faced a situation where the event's menu did not accommodate your dietary restrictions. You chose to back out of the event and request your money back because you could not partake in the provided food options. Your decision appears to be based on practical considerations regarding your health and well-being rather than an exaggerated fear of negative outcomes.

Furthermore, while H and her friends expressed frustration, labeling you as ""petty,"" this reaction reflects their perspective on the situation rather than indicating that you are catastrophizing. Your choice to prioritize your dietary needs and stand by it suggests a rational and self-considerate approach rather than an overestimation of negative consequences.

Catastrophizing,o1-mini,"
I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual expects the worst possible outcome or dramatically exaggerates the significance of negative events. In the provided example, the narrator is reacting to a friend's claim of being smarter than 95% of the population. The narrator expresses skepticism and challenges this assertion but does not necessarily anticipate or expect the worst-case scenario from this interaction. Instead, the focus is on addressing what the narrator perceives as an inflated sense of intelligence in their friend.

The behavior described—criticizing or questioning someone's self-assessment—is more aligned with interpersonal conflict or frustration rather than catastrophizing. The narrator is not magnifying the potential negative outcomes of the situation but is instead challenging the friend's overestimation of intelligence.

Catastrophizing,o1-mini,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

In the provided scenario, the user describes a situation where they felt that bringing their girlfriend, Jane, to a friends' party ""ruined"" the night. This statement suggests that the user is viewing the outcome of the event in an exaggeratedly negative light. While it’s understandable that the presence of someone who doesn't get along with the group can create discomfort, labeling the entire night as ""ruined"" may be an overstatement. This could indicate that the user is engaging in catastrophizing by amplifying the negative impact of the situation.

Catastrophizing,o1-mini,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual anticipates the worst possible outcome in a situation, often without sufficient evidence to support such a dire expectation. It involves magnifying the potential negative consequences, leading to heightened anxiety and distress.

In the scenario you've provided, the expression ""I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one"" indicates an anticipation of negative judgment or criticism. However, as the story unfolds, the anticipated negative outcome does manifest to some extent—your fiancé faces consequences, and others perceive you unfavorably. This alignment between your expectations and the actual outcomes suggests that your prediction wasn't unfounded or irrational.

Catastrophizing typically involves expecting excessively negative results that are unlikely or disproportionate to the situation. In your case, while you did foresee negative repercussions, they were based on the unfolding events rather than an exaggerated or unjustified fear.

Catastrophizing,o1-mini,"Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

It’s been a few days and I thought he’d have calmed down by now but he’s still sulking and I’m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I’m the AH here.",0,"Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual expects the worst possible outcome in a situation, often without sufficient evidence to support such a bleak outlook. In the scenario you've provided, Harry's reaction to his wife attending a children's birthday party while he's ill seems more aligned with feelings of abandonment, frustration, or emotional distress rather than catastrophizing.

Harry was already in a vulnerable state due to his illness, and his strong emotional reaction might stem from feeling neglected or unsupported rather than from anticipating an extreme negative outcome like harm or disaster. There's no indication that he expected the worst possible scenario to occur because his wife went to the party.
